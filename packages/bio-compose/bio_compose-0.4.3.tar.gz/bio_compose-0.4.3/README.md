# BioCompose: Create, execute, and introspect reproducible composite simulations of dynamic biological systems.
#### __This service utilizes separate containers for REST API management, job processing, and datastorage with MongoDB, ensuring scalable and robust performance.__

## Getting Started:

### **HIGH-LEVEL `bio_compose` API:**

The primary method of user-facing interaction for this service is done through the use of a high-level "notebook" api called `bio_check`. 
A convenient notebook demonstrating the functionality of this service is hosted on Google Colab and can be accessed by clicking the above "Open In Colab" badge.

[View the template notebook as markdown](documentation/verification_api_demo.md)


Installation of this tooling can be performed using PyPI as such:

```bash
pip install bio-compose
```

#### Alternatively, **the REST API can be accessed via Swagger UI here: [https://biochecknet.biosimulations.org/docs](https://biochecknet.biosimulations.org/docs)
