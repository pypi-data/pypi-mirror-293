## About

**Ramannoodle** is a Python API for efficiently calculating Raman spectra from first principles calculations. Ramannoodle supports molecular-dynamics- and phonon-based Raman calculations and includes interfaces with VASP.

Ramannoodle is designed from the ground up to be:

1. **EFFICIENT**

   Ramannoodle provides `PolarizabilityModel`'s to reduce the required number of first-principles polarizability calculations.

2. **FLEXIBLE**

    Ramannoodle provides a simple, object-oriented API that makes calculations a breeze while offering plenty of flexibility to carry out advanced analyses and add new functionality.

3. **TRANSPARENT**

    Ramannoodle is designed to give the user a good understanding of what is being calculated at varying levels of abstraction.

Ramannoodle includes interfaces with:

* VASP
* phonopy (planned)

## Installation

Ramannoodle can be installed via pip:

`
$ pip install ramannoodle
`
