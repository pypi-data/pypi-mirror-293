CollabAgents is a versatile Python framework developed by Vishnu Durairaj, designed to facilitate the creation of intelligent AI agents equipped with a diverse range of tools and functionalities. This open-source framework simplifies the development of sophisticated AI systems capable of handling various tasks through role-based agents and supports advanced multi-agent orchestration.

## Features

- **Create AI Agents with Tools**: Easily build AI agents with a diverse set of tools, from Python execution to file operations and terminal commands.
- **Role-Based Agents**: Define agents with specific roles and responsibilities to handle different tasks and collaborate effectively.
- **Interacting Entities**: Simulate scenarios where multiple agents or companies work together to complete user requests.
- **Flexible Integration**: Supports both Anthropic and OpenAI models, providing flexibility in choosing the best AI model for your needs.

## Installation

You can install the CollabAgents framework using pip:

```bash

pip install CollabAgents

```

## Example Use Case

### 1. Agents With Tools

Here’s an example of how to create a agent with tools using CollabAgents:

```python
import os
from CollabAgents.helper import print_colored
from CollabAgents.agent import StructuredAgent
from CollabAgents.models import OpenaiChatModel
from CollabAgents.tools.FileOperationsTool import SaveFile, CreateFolder

# Step 1: This concise description helps in understanding the agent's responsibilities and guides the system 
# in determining what types of tasks should be assigned to this agent. 
description = "Responsible for writing story."

# Step 2: Provide instructions for the agent (System Prompt)
instruction = "You are a creative storyteller who crafts imaginative narratives with vivid details, rich characters, and unexpected plot twists."

# Step 3: Load pre-defined tools that the agent will use
# These tools enable the agent to create folders and save files
tools = [CreateFolder, SaveFile]

# Step 4: Set your OpenAI API key
openai_api_key = "You API Key"
# openai_api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Step 5: Initialize the language model for the agent
model = OpenaiChatModel(model_name="gpt-4o-mini", api_key=openai_api_key, temperature=0)

# Step 6: Initialize the agent with the model, description, instructions, and tools. Set verbose to True to see the steps by step actions.
agent = StructuredAgent(model=model, agent_name="AI Assistant", agent_description=description, agent_instructions=instruction, tools=tools, assistant_agents=[],max_allowed_attempts=50, verbose=True)

print_colored("Starting the application...........", "green")

# Example user input
user_input = "Create a story about AI agents and save it in a new folder. The story should have two chapters, and each chapter should be saved separately inside the folder"

# Initialize the messages list to store conversation history
messages = []

# Step 7: Process user input and interact with the agent
while user_input != "bye":
    # The agent processes the user input and generates a response
    output = agent.run(user_input, messages)

    # Update the messages list with the agent's response
    messages = agent.messages

    # If verbose=False is set during agent initialization, uncomment the following line to see the agent's responses
    # print_colored(f"Assistant : {output}", "purple")

    # Prompt the user for the next input
    user_input = input("User Input : ")

```

### 2. Creating Custom Tools

Here’s an example of how to create a custom tool using pydantic base model:

```python
import os
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel,Field

class AppendToFile(BaseModel):
    # Based on this docstring, the model will determine when to use this tool. Ensure it clearly describes the tool's purpose.
    """
    Use this tool to append content to an existing file.
    """
    # Provides justification for selecting this tool, helping to ensure it is chosen appropriately and not at random. You can ignore this.
    reasoning :List[str] = Field(description="Why you are using this tool")

    # Thses are the required argument with its data types clearly declared.
    file_name: str = Field(..., description="File name to append to.") 
    content: str = Field(..., description="Content to append.")

    # Every tool must include a `run` method. This method will be called dynamically during interactions to perform the tool's primary function.
    def run(self):
        try:
            with open(self.file_name, "a") as file:
                file.write(self.content)
            return f"Content appended to file: {self.file_name}"
        except Exception as e:
            return f"An error occurred while appending to the file: {str(e)}"
    
AppendToFile(reasoning=["Thoughts"],file_name="path to the file",content="content to append").run()

```
### 3. Multi-Agents

Here’s an example of how to create a multiple agents with tools using CollabAgents:

```python

from CollabAgents.models import AnthropicModel
from CollabAgents.agent import StructuredAgent
from CollabAgents.tools.FileOperationsTool import CreateFolder,SaveFile,ListFilesInDirectory,ReadTextFile

api_key = "API KEY"

model = AnthropicModel(model_name="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",api_key=api_key,temperature=0)

# Let's Build a story writing company with 3 agents (CEO, Story Planner, Story Writer)

# ----------------------------------------------Create Story Planner Agent --------------------------------------

# Description for the Story Planner agent
