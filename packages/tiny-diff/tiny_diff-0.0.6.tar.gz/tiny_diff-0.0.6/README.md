# Tiny Diff (Beta)

This project attempts to provide a minimal implementation of diffusion models written in pure python, without huggingface dependencies.

It aims to:

- Be object oriented to enable end users to extend the SDK for their custom workflows
- Be, as it name states, easy to use (hence focused in simple usecases)
- Have as little duplicated code as possible.

You can check more info at the [documentation site](https://tiny-diff.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Conditional diffusion is still to be included.



# Installation

Simply run 
```bash
pip install tiny-diff
```
# Quickstart
