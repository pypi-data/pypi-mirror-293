## Overview
FADE is a project aimed at detecting fallacies in various forms of speech. Upgrading and optimizing this tool will enable the identification of unethical, manipulative, and persuasive discourse from politicians, influencers, and even our friends and families.

## Roadmap
- Implement a video-transcription feature
- Optimize current prompt system
- Fine-tune a LLM to test if the results are better

## Installation
We recommend setting up a virtual environment before starting to work with FADE:
- Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
- Activate your virtual environment: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`

To begin using our library, simply install it via pip:
`pip install fade`

## Setting Up FADE
Before running the bellow script create a `.env` file and place your API Key inside it: `GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key"`. 

### Simple detection in string
```python
from src.fade.fallacy_detector import detect_fallacy

phrase = "I'm better than you because I'm taller than you"

print(detect_fallacy(phrase))
```

### Simple detection in speech-to-text
For this feature you have to setup you google cloud feature  first and your google-cloud-speech api. 

```python
import sys
import os

sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))

from src.fade.transcription_features.live_transcription import main as lt
from src.fade.fallacy_detector import *

text = lt()

print(detect_fallacy(text))
```
