	confocal projection imaging plugin for an oblique plane microscopy. 
</h2>
</h1>`

### Overview
Oblique plane microscopes (OPMs) are a class of light-sheet microscopes that obliquely
illuminate the sample, and use aberration-free remote focusing to reorient the captured 
fluorescence onto a 2D camera array. This plugin provides a confocal projection imaging
mode for the OPM, which allows the user to capture a 2D projection of the sample at a
given depth.
