    """ConProAcquisition class for controlling continuous acquisition.

    This class provides functionality to control continuous acquisition, including
    managing scan range, offsets, channels, and signal acquisition.

    Notes:
    ------
    - This class is used to control continuous acquisition during microscopy
    experiments, allowing for adjustments in scan range, offsets, and channels.

    - The continuous acquisition process involves initializing parameters, controlling
    signal acquisition, and managing offsets and channels.

    - The `config_table` attribute defines the configuration for the continuous
    acquisition process, including signal acquisition and node type.

    - Does not have multi-position capabilities for now.
