PASETO are a simpler, yet more secure alternative to JWTs.

```bash
pip install fastapi-paseto
```

## Roadmap
- Support for WebSocket authorization

## FAQ
- **Where's support for tokens in cookies?**\
I mostly forked fastapi-jwt-auth because I needed a library to use for authentication using PASETO tokens in my private FastAPI Application. Which is why I only kept the functionality that I personally required.\
Personally, I'm not a fan of saving data in cookies, and cookie support made up a big part of the code which just didn't make sense for me to bother adapting.\
Hence, I likely will not be implementing support for storing PASETO tokens in cookies unless there is a considerable amount of people wanting it.\
However, I will gladly accept PRs implementing tokens in cookies if someone else wants to implement it.
