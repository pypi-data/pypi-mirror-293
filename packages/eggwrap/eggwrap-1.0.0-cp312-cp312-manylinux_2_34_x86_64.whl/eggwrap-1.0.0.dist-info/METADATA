# eggwrap
eggwrap is a wrapper for the Rust equality saturation framework [egg](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434304).
eggwrap is a heavily-modified fork of [TENSAT](https://github.com/uwplse/tensat), with equality saturation rules tailored to the needs of the [CoolerSpace library](https://github.com/horizon-research/CoolerSpace).
eggwrap is _not_ meant to be used as a standalone program!
