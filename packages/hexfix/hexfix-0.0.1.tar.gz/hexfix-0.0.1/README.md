# Checksum Generation for S-Record Range

## Overview

This project provides a Python tool for generating checksums from a specific range of addresses within an S-record file. The checksum is calculated using the CRC32 algorithm provided by the `zlib` module in Python. This tool is useful for verifying the integrity of data records in S-record files by computing checksums over specified address ranges.

## Features

- Calculate CRC32 checksum for data records in an S-record file.
- Specify a range of addresses to compute the checksum.
- Handle trimming of data to fit within the specified range.
