SU2GUI is a Python-based graphical user interface designed to simplify the setup, execution, and analysis of simulations using the SU2 software suite. It offers an intuitive interface with real-time visualization and comprehensive case management capabilities.

All documentation is available online at [SU2 GUI Docs](http://su2code.github.io/su2gui/Introduction). If you're just getting started, hereâ€™s how we recommend you navigate the docs:

- First, read the [Installation Guide](http://su2code.github.io/su2gui/Installation/) for instructions on setting up SU2GUI and its dependencies.

- After downloading, start the GUI with:

  SU2_GUI [-h] [-p PORT] [-c CASE] [-m MESH] [--config CONFIG] [--restart RESTART]

- Next, explore the [QuickStart Guide](https://su2code.github.io/su2gui/quick-start) to quickly get up and running with your first simulation.
