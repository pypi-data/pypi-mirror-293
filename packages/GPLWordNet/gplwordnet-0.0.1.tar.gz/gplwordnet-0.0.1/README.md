## Introduction
GPLWordNey is a lexcion generating tool, using WordNet as database to find two sets of lexcions.

It provides:
- full expand - This function is used for finding target words' antonyms, synsets, adjectives, derivational words, and hyponyms.
- antonyms expand - This function is used for finding target words' antonyms

Testing:

Test can then be run after installation with:
```{python}
    data1 = [{'term': 'good', 'PoS': 'ADJECTIVE'}]
    print(full_expand(data1))
    
    data2 = [{'term': 'good', 'PoS': 'ADJECTIVE'},
          {'term': 'competence', 'PoS': 'Noun'}]
    print(full_expand(data2))
    
    data3 = [{'term': 'good', 'PoS': 'ADV', 'sense': 1},
          {'term': 'competence', 'PoS': 'Noun'}]
    print(antonyms_expand(data3))
```
