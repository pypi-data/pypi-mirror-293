# pythOnmarg

The Python version of the onmaRg package.

pythOnmarg makes Public Health Ontario's "Ontario Marginalization Index" (OnMarg) datasets accessible as a geo dataframe using spatial files from Statistics Canada.  OnMarg data can be loaded for the 2011, 2016, and 2021 data sets.  The inclusion of all levels of Stats Canada geography means data can be filtered by CD, CSD, etc.
