INSTALL             : Build, installation and brief usage instructions.
FILES               : This file.
CMakeLists.txt......: Configuration file for building and installing via CMake
                      (cf. the INSTALL file for instructions).
data/...............: Material data files in NCrystals native format (.ncmat).
examples/...........: Small standalone examples for using NCrystal, either from
                      the commandline, C, C++ or python applications or through
                      Geant4 simulations in C++.
ncrystal_core/......: The core NCrystal code implemented in C++. Public header
                      files for C++ and C are available in the
                      ncrystal_core/include/NCrystal/ directory, and the
                      implementation is in ncrystal_core/src/. Internal header
                      files can also be accessed in the internal/ subdirectory,
                      but are not guaranteed to present a stable API, and also
                      do not contain NCRYSTAL_API statements needed for symbol
                      visibility in certain builds.
ncrystal_geant4/....: NCrystal-Geant4 interface classes, with public header
                      files for Geant4-dependent C++ code available in the
                      ncrystal_geant4/include/G4NCrystal/ directory, and the
                      implementation in ncrystal_geant4/src/.
NCrystal/...........: NCrystal python modules.
scripts/............: Command-line scripts, including the nctool command and
                      various tools for NCMAT file preparation.
docs/...............: Extra documentation. Currently this is just ncmat_doc.md
                      with a thorough description of the NCMAT format.
cmake/..............: Other files needed for CMake configuration.
setup.py............: Support building and installing via standard Python
                      tool-chains.
pyproject.toml......: Like setup.py, needed for the standard Python tool-chains.
