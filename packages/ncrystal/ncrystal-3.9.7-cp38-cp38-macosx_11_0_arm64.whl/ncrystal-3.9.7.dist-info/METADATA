NCrystal is a library and associated tools which enables calculations for Monte Carlo simulations of thermal neutrons in crystals and other materials, supporting a range of physics including both coherent, incoherent, elastic and inelastic scatterings in a wide range of materials, including crystal powders, mosaic single crystals, layered single crystals, amorphous solids, and liquids. Multiphase materials or isotopically enriched materials are supported as well, and the framework furthermore supports phase-contrast (SANS) physics.
