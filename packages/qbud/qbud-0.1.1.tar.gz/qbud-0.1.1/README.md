## qBud Python Client
`qbud` helps to make interaction with qBud assistants easier. Its aim is to provide a low-code solution for interactions with assistants that you have configured via the UI.

### How to Install
Installing is easy:
```commandline
pip install qbud
```
We recommend `python>=3.9`, but the client may run with older versions as well. The only external dependency is the widely used `requests` library, which is installed when running the above command.

### Quickstart
You can quickly get started by following the steps below:

#### 1. Configure credentials
The client consumes the environment variables `QBUD_CLIENT_ID` and `QBUD_CLIENT_SECRET`. Retrieve your credentials from [the application](https://app.qbud.ai/account) and set them. Never send credentials to others.

#### 2. Connect to an assistant
Make sure you have built an assistant via our UI. When you're editing the assistant there, copy the ID from the address bar (after '/assistants/') to connect with our client.
```python
from qbud import Assistant

assistant = Assistant("<your-assistant-id>")
```

#### 3. Send messages
Sending messages is simple. Create a `Chat` instance for the relevant assistant and call `send_message(...)` with whatever you'd like to send:
```python
chat = assistant.create_chat()
response = chat.send_message("Hi!")
print(response)
> {"content": "Hi there!", "role": "assistant"}
```

### Other features
By design, chat messages history cannot be retrieved from our API. If you require the chat history in the future, you have to take care of saving chats locally. Our client's API offers functionality for this:
```python
from qbud import Chat

# save a Chat object as JSON
chat.save("chat.json")

# ...session terminates

# load a Chat instance from the saved JSON 
chat = Chat.load("chat.json")
```

Besides inspecting the JSON file, you can also use `get_messages(...)` to get an object containing the chat history:

```python
print(chat.get_messages())
> [{"content": "Hi!", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Hi there!", "role": "assistant"}]
```
