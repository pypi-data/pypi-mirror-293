        Add a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of code that shows the problem.

        * You can `print(obj)` a SkPy object to produce a more readable summary of its contents.

        Run your code sample and paste the output below.

        * Set the `SKPY_DEBUG_HTTP=1` environment variable so that requests to the Skype API are logged.

        * Make sure to redact any personal information -- authentication tokens, passwords, usernames, email addresses, contact details etc.

        * Tidying up the output:
          * For a large log, try to reduce it to the relevant method or API call.
          * For tracebacks, include the full stack trace (starting from `Traceback (most recent call last):` and ending with the exception message itself).
          * If in doubt, paste the full output.

        What went wrong?  How should this code behave instead?

        * Test the corresponding action on [Skype for Web](https://web.skype.com) and describe how it differs.

        * For authentication issues, say what credentials you're using -- Skype username, email address or phone number.

        * For conversations or messages, say which chat types are affected (either 1-to-1s or groups, and with Skype contacts, external users or bots).

        * If sending files or pictures in a message, attach or link a sample of what you're trying to send.
