# hold info to connect to an agent
# manager for message history
# functions to convert message history into containers to
# include in payload of messages to agent

# use kg objects for messages and message history
# with new message being an "intent"

# agent response to include new kg objects to add into the history
# so agent is initially given interaction and then returns objects
# to add to it given the incoming message
# which should follow the pattern in the groovy implementation and
# handoff to the agent via containers of objects
