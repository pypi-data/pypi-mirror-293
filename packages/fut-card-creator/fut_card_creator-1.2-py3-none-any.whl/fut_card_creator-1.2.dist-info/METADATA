- Automatically fetch and cache club logos and national flags using online APIs.
- Easily customize and update player stats.
- Automatically calculate the overall rating for players based on their position.
- Automatically update player stats when their overall rating changes.
- Export the generated FUT card as an image file.

## Installation

To install FUT Card Creator, simply run:

```bash
pip install fut_card_creator
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `Pillow` for image processing
- `requests` for API calls
- `fuzzywuzzy` and `python-Levenshtein` for fuzzy string matching

These dependencies will be installed automatically when you install the package.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the FUT Card Creator:

```python
from fut_card_creator.fut_card_creator import Player, Card

# Create a Player instance
player = Player(
    name="Lionel Messi",
    photo_path="path/to/messi_photo.png",
    club="Paris Saint-Germain",
    nation="Argentina",
    overall=93,
    position="RW",
    stats={"PAC": 85, "SHO": 92, "PAS": 91, "DRI": 95, "DEF": 35, "PHY": 65}
)

# Create a FUT card
fut_card = Card(player, card_type="gold")

# Generate the card image
fut_card.create_image()

# Export the card image
fut_card.export_image("messi_fut_card.png")
```

### Automatic Overall Calculation

The FUT Card Creator automatically calculates a playerâ€™s overall rating based on their position and individual stats. Each position has a unique formula that emphasizes different stats, ensuring that the overall rating reflects the playerâ€™s role on the field.

### Automatic Stat Updater

When you update a player's overall rating, the package automatically adjusts the player's stats to match the new overall. This ensures that the stats are consistent with the player's new rating, maintaining a realistic balance.

### Customization

You can easily customize various aspects of the FUT card, such as:

- **Player stats**: Modify individual stats using the `Player` class.
- **Card type**: Use different card templates by specifying the `card_type` in the `Card` class. (rare_gold, gold, silver_rare, totw, toty, tots, future_star, icon)
- **Image paths**: Provide paths to player photos, club logos, and nation flags.
