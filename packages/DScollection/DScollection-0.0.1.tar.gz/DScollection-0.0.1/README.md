# This is very simple implementaion of Data Structure like Stack and Singly Linked List

* You can use the basic method of the Stack lik push, pop, peek, isEmpty, printStack. Here is the list:-

python
1) push(val) #provide any valu as argument to push into stack
2) pop() #It will pop or delete the top element of stack
3) peek() #It will give you the top element
4) isEmpty() #It will tell you whether the stack is empty or not
5) printStack() #It will print the stack in form of list

Note:- if you initialize the stack size to 5 and you push only 3 element or less then 5 element then rest of the stack will print as 0 because initially all the value in stack is 0
---

* In Singly Linked List you can use so many methods here is the list:-

    
python
    1) len()
    2) is_empty() #Make sure you use this method inside the print function
    3) traverse() #To print the linked list
    4) insertAtHead(val) #Provide any value as argument
    5) insertAtTail(val) #Provide any value as argument
    6) insertAtPos(val, pos) #First provide the value and then position
    7) deleteHead() #It will delete the head node
    8) deleteTail() #It will delete the tail node
    9) deleteAtPosition(pos) #Provide the position of node you want to delete
    10) insertAfter(val, newVal) #First provide the value after which you want to add a new value. E.g:- after 5 you want to add 6 then insertAfter(5, 6)
    11) insertBefore(val, newVal) #First provide the value before which you want to add a new value. E.g:- before 5 you want to add 6 then insertBefore(5, 6)
    12) get_tail() #It will print the tail node
    13) get_head() #It will print the head node


## Here is the exmaple 

* Stack
    
python
    from DScollection import *

    #OR
    # from DScollection import Stack
    # from DScollection import SinglyLL

    s1 = Stack(5) #here 5 is the size of stack
    s1.push(1)
    s1.push(2)
    s1.push(3)
    s1.push(4)
    s1.push(5)
    #you can also use loop to push to avoid this number of lines
    s1.pop()
    s1.peek()
    s1.isEmpty()
    s1.printStack()

* Singly Linked List
    
python
    from DScollection import *

    #OR
    # from DScollection import Stack
    # from DScollection import SinglyLL

    l1 = SinglyLL() #here 5 is the size of stack
    l1.insertAtHead(5)
    l1.insertAtHead(6)
    l1.traverse()


# I will update this with all the data structure with ready to use
