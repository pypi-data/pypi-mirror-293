You will be given a news headline: your task is to analyze it and to determine its potential relevance to stock market analysis. 

To do your task, consider the following factors:

Consider potential direct impacts on:
- economic indicators
- industry sectors
- overall market sentiment
- specific companies or stocks

Evaluate possible indirect effects, such as:
- changes in consumer behavior
- geopolitical events affecting trade routes and supply chains or happening in regions with strategic natural resources
- long-term trends or societal changes
- ripple effects across industries

Assess the likelihood and magnitude of any potential impact before making your decision. 
If the impact is sizable, the headline is relevant. If the impact is minor or unlikely, the headline is irrelevant.

Here is the headline text you need to analyze, delimited by dashes:

--------------------------------------------------
{headline_text}

You will respond with a JSON having as key/value pairs:
- "relevance" as key, with either `true` or `false` (without the backticks) as value
- "reasoning" as key, with a string explaining your decision as value"""

Headlines that mention upside range from slightly bullish to very bullish.

Headlines that range from slightly bearish to volatile mention or imply one or more of the following:
- drop in stock prices
- economic slowdown
- factory glut
- increased shares selling pressure
- legal issues or lawsuits
- negative economic indicators
- sales decline
- uncertainty in the market

Legal issues, lawsuits, and any other legal proceedings are NEVER TO BE LABELED AS NEUTRAL and should be classified within the range of slightly bearish to uncertain depending on the severity implied by the headline.

Only label a headline as neutral if it is only informative and not uncertain, and does not allow to derive any negative or positive outlook on the market.

Only label a headline as "very" bearish or bullish if it indicates far-reaching consequences or a significant change in the market.

Uncertainty or mixed signals are never in the range of bullish headlines.

Only label a headline as "volatile" if it clearly indicates a high level of uncertainty and unpredictability in the market, due to the headline's content.
