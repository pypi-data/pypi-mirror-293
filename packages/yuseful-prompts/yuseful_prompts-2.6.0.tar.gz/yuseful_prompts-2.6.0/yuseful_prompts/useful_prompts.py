You will be given a news headline: your task is to analyze it and to determine its potential relevance in analyzing stock market short, long, and mid-term trends.

To do your task, consider the following factors:

Consider potential direct impacts on:
- economic indicators
- industry sectors
- overall market sentiment
- specific companies or stocks

Evaluate possible indirect effects, such as:
- changes in consumer behavior
- geopolitical events affecting trade routes and supply chains or happening in regions with strategic natural resources
- long-term trends or societal changes
- ripple effects across industries

The psychological impact of the news on market participants is also an important factor to consider. 

Assess the likelihood and magnitude of any potential impact before making your decision
If the impact is sizable, the headline is relevant. If the impact is minor or unlikely, the headline is irrelevant.
Be mindful of not overestimating the relevance of the headline: only consider the most likely and significant impacts.

The category should have the right balance in granularity: not too general and not too specific. This is important because it helps in organizing and classifying news content effectively.

Guidelines for determining appropriate granularity:
1. Too general: Avoid broad categories like "News" or "Current Events" that could apply to almost any headline.
2. Too specific: Avoid categories that are so narrow they would rarely be used for other headlines.
3. Aim for a middle ground: The category should be specific enough to give a clear idea of the headline's content, but general enough to potentially include other similar stories.

Analyze the headline carefully, considering its main topic, themes, and context. Think about what section of a news website or newspaper this headline might appear in.

- factory glut
- increased shares selling pressure
- legal issues or lawsuits
- negative economic indicators
- sales decline
- uncertainty in the market

Legal issues, lawsuits, and any other legal proceedings are NEVER TO BE LABELED AS NEUTRAL and should be classified within the range of slightly bearish to uncertain depending on the severity implied by the headline.

Only label a headline as neutral if it is only informative and not uncertain, and does not allow to derive any negative or positive outlook on the market.

Only label a headline as "very" bearish or bullish if it indicates far-reaching consequences or a significant change in the market.

Uncertainty or mixed signals are never in the range of bullish headlines.

Only label a headline as "volatile" if it clearly indicates a high level of uncertainty and unpredictability in the market, due to the headline's content.
