# yuseful_prompts

## what is this ?

This is a simple python package that uses `ollama` with prompts I'm finding useful for my own projects.

## pre requisites

- `ollama` installed with a model of your chosing referenced in as the `DEFAULT_MODEL` in `yuseful_prompts/useful_prompts.py`

## test

- `python3 -m pytest -v ./yuseful_prompts/test_useful_prompts.py`
