`quizzable` provides an easy-to-implement interface to build a framework for educational quiz apps built on top of Python. The `quizzable` library allows you to create quizzes consisting of MCQ, FRQ, True-or-false, or Matching questions, allowing you to build educational apps that leverage the power of Python with great ease. The full documentation is described below.

## Quickstart

To get started, install the `quizzable` package through `pip` on a supported version of Python (`quizzable` currently supports Python 3.9+):
```console
$ python -m pip install quizzable
```
Next, import the [`Terms`](#terms) class from the `quizzable` module:
```py
from quizzable import Terms
```
Then, create a list of terms:
```py
data = {
    "painter": "la pintura",
    "brush": "el pincel",
    "sculpture": "la escultura",
    "palette:": "la paleta",
    "self-portrait": "el autorretrato",
    "abstract": "abstracto/a",
    # more terms...
}
terms = Terms(data)
```
or create one from JSON data:
```py
import json

with open("vocabulary.json") as terms_file:
    terms = Terms(json.loads(terms_file.read()))
```
Aftewards, you can choose to generate random types of questions using the [`get_random_question`](#termsget_random_question) method:
```py
question = terms.get_random_question()
```
generate an entire quiz of questions using the [`get_quiz`](#termsget_quiz) method:
```py
quiz = terms.get_quiz(
    types=["mcq", "match", "tf"],
    prompt="What is the translation of {term}?",
)  # customize question types and prompt
```
Or create different types of questions manually like so:
```py
frq = terms.get_frq_question()  # free-response
mcq = terms.get_mcq_question()  # multiple-choice
tf = terms.get_true_false_question()  # true-or-false
matching = terms.get_frq_question()  # matching
```
A question has different properties, depending on its type:
```py
print(mcq.prompt)
for option in mcq.options:
    print(option)
print()
answer = input("Answer: ")
```
To score a question, simply use its [`check_answer`](#questioncheck_answer) method:
```py
correct, actual = mcq.check_answer(answer)
if correct:
    print("Correct!")
else:
    print(f"Incorrect...the answer was {actual}")
```
If you'd like, you can convert a question or quiz to back to its raw data at any time:
```py
print(question.to_dict())
print(quiz.to_data())
```

## Classes

### `Terms`
A list of terms.

Should be a dictionary mapping _terms_ to _definitions_, where in this case a _term_ represents a question or vocabulary term, and a _definition_ is used to refer to the answer or vocabulary definition. For example, here is a list of terms in which each term is an English word, and its definition is its English translation:

```py
{
    "painter": "la pintura",
    "brush": "el pincel",
    "sculpture": "la escultura",
    "palette:": "la paleta",
    "self-portrait": "el autorretrato",
    "abstract": "abstracto/a"
}
```

#### `Terms.get_terms()`
Parameters:
* `answer_with = "def"`: can be `"term"`, `"def"`, or `"both"`; how the question should be answered (see [Functions](#functions))

Returns the dictionary `terms` modified based on the value for `answer_with`. May be useful for making flashcards for which terms and definitions may need to be swapped on-demand.

#### `Terms.get_frq_question()`
Returns an [`FRQQuestion`](#frqquestion) object with a random FRQ-format question generated from `terms`.

Parameters:
* `prompt = "{term}"`: question prompt (use `"{term}"` to reference question term in custom prompts)

#### `Terms.get_mcq_question()`
Parameters:
* `n_options = 4`: number of options per question.
* `prompt = "{term}"`: question prompt (use `"{term}"` to reference question term in custom prompts)

Returns an [`MCQQuestion`](#mcqquestion) object with a random MCQ-format question generated from `terms`.

#### `Terms.get_true_false_question()`
Returns a [`TrueFalseQuestion`](#truefalsequestion) object with a random True-or-false format question generated from `terms`.

Parameters:
* `prompt = "{term}"`: question prompt (use `"{term}"` to reference question term in custom prompts)

#### `Terms.get_match_question()`
Parameters:
* `n_terms = 5`: how many terms have to be matched
* `prompt = "{term}"`: question prompt (use `"{term}"` to reference question term in custom prompts)

Returns a [`MatchQuestion`](#matchquestion) object with a random matching-format question generated from `terms`.

#### `Terms.get_random_question()`
Parameters:
* `types = ["mcq", "frq", "tf"]`: list that can contain `"mcq"`, `"frq"`, `"tf"`, or `"match"`; types of questions that appear on the quiz
* `n_options = 4`: (if MCQs are involved) number of options per MCQ question
* `n_terms = 5`: (if matching questions are involved) number of terms to match per matching question
* `prompt = "{term}"`: question prompt (use `"{term}"` to reference question term in custom prompts)
* `prompts = {}`: prompt map to define specific prompts for specific questions

Returns a `Question` object of a random-format question generated from `terms`.

#### `Terms.get_quiz()`
Returns a [`Quiz`](#quiz) object with random questions based on the below parameters.

Parameters:
* `terms`: map of terms and definitions for quiz (see [`Terms`](#terms))
* `types = ["mcq", "frq", "tf"]`: list that can contain `"mcq"`, `"frq"`, `"tf"`, or `"match"`; types of questions that appear on the quiz
* `length = 10`: number of questions on quiz
* `answer_with = "def"`: can be `"term"`, `"def"`, or `"both"`; how the question should be answered (see below)
* `n_options = 4`: (if MCQs are involved) number of options per MCQ question
* `n_terms = 5`: (if matching questions are involved) number of terms to match per matching question
* `prompt = "{term}"`: question prompt (use `"{term}"` to reference question term in custom prompts)
* `prompts = {}`: prompt map to define specific prompts for specific questions

`answer_with` describes how the user should answer the question, where `"term"` means a question should be answered by giving the term, `"def"` implies that the question should be answered by providing the definition, and `"both"` means that there is a 50/50 chance of the question needing a term or a definition as input.

### `Quiz`
Arbitrary quiz object.
#### `Quiz.questions`
List of questions within the quiz, represented by a list of arbitrary `Question` objects.

#### `Quiz.from_data()`
Reconstructs a `Quiz` object from a listlike representation. See [`Quiz.to_data()`](#quizto_data) for more information on formatting.

#### `Quiz.to_data()`
Returns a listlike representation of the quiz, with each `Question` object being represented as its dictionary representation. For example, it could look like this:
```py
[
    {
        "_type": "tf",
        "term": "la iglesia",
        "definition": "shop",
        "answer": "church",
        "prompt": "la iglesia"
    },
    {
        "_type": "mcq",
        "term": "la playa",
        "options": {
            "beach": True,
            "park": False,
            "downtown": False,
            "museum": False,
        },
        "prompt": "la playa"
    },
    {
        "_type": "frq",
        "term": "park",
        "answer": "el parque",
        "prompt": "park"
    }
]
```
