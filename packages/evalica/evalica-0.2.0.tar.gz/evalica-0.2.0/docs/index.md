# Evalica

**Evalica** is a Python library that transforms pairwise comparisons into ranked lists of items. It offers convenient high-performant Rust implementations of the corresponding methods via [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/), and additionally provides naÃ¯ve Python code for most of them. Evalica is fully compatible with [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) arrays and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data frames.

## Installation

- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/): `pip install evalica` [![PyPI Version][pypi_badge]][pypi_link]
- [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/): `conda install conda-forge::evalica` [![Anaconda.org][conda_badge]][conda_link]

## Usage

Imagine that we would like to rank the different meals and have the following dataset of three comparisons produced by food experts.

| **Item X**| **Item Y** | **Winner** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `pizza` | `burger` | `x` |
| `burger` | `sushi` | `y` |
| `pizza` | `sushi` | `tie` |

Given this hypothetical example, Evalica takes these three columns and computes the outcome of the given pairwise comparison according to the chosen model. Note that the first argument is the column `Item X`, the second argument is the column `Item Y`, and the third argument corresponds to the column `Winner`.

```python
>>> from evalica import elo, Winner
>>> result = elo(
...     ['pizza', 'burger', 'pizza'],
...     ['burger', 'sushi', 'sushi'],
...     [Winner.X, Winner.Y, Winner.Draw],
... )
>>> result.scores
pizza     1014.972058
burger     970.647200
sushi     1014.380742
Name: elo, dtype: float64
```

As a result, we obtain [Elo scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) of our items. In this example, `pizza` was the most favoured item, `sushi` was the runner-up, and `burger` was the least preferred item.

| **Item**| **Score** |
|---|---:|
| `pizza` | 1014.97 |
| `burger` | 970.65 |
| `sushi` | 1014.38 |

## Command-Line Interface

Evalica also provides a simple command-line interface, allowing the use of these methods in shell scripts and for prototyping.

```
$ evalica -i food.csv bradley-terry
item,score,rank
Tacos,0.43428827947351706,1
Sushi,0.19060105855071743,2
Burger,0.14797720376982199,3
Pasta,0.12815347866987045,4
Pizza,0.0989799795360731,5
