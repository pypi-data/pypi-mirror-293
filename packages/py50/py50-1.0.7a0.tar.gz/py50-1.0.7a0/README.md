## Summary

The aim of py50 is to make the generation of dose-respnose curves and annotated plots with statistics. The project was
created primarily for my personal use and for my coworkers/classmates. I found many of my classmates/coworkers were
using a program that I find to be unfriendly in generating dose-response curves or with calculating statistics and
plots. During my search, I found other helpful repositories that can generate dose-response curves, calculate
statistics, or make annotated plots. However, I found that these packages did not meet my requirements:

1. Use Pandas for the Data so that it can be easily plugged into a Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts
2. Adaptable to user needs
3. Easy to use (hopefully!)

The dose-response curves are built on the four parameter logistic regression model:
$$Y = \text{Min} + \frac{\text{Max} - \text{Min}}{1 + \left(\frac{X}{\text{IC50}}\right)^{\text{Hill coefficient}}}$$
where min is the minimum response value, max is the maximum response value, Y is the response values of the curves, X
is the concentration.

The statistics and annotated plots is a wrapper for [Pingouin](https://github.com/raphaelvallat/pingouin)
and [Statannotations](https://github.com/trevismd/statannotations).
This may have been done inelegantly and will be updated based on my use or recommendations by other users. As things
stand, this project meets my and the needs of my classmates/coworkers. Hopefully it can meet the needs of others.

## Installation

```
pip install py50
```

Pacakge can be upgraded specifically using pip with the following:

```
pip install py50 -U
```

**Warning:** As of this writing, Statannotations is at v0.6. It is incompatible with Seaborn â‰¥v0.12 or with Pandas
â‰¥v.2.0.
During testing, I found that Seaborn v0.12.2 had no issues. This is advantages because v0.12 allows better control of
error bars for the bar plot. Unfortunately, the python packaging system I use, Poetry, will not successfully build if
there are conflicts. Thus, the py50 installation will install Seaborn v0.11.2 instead. As written, py50 will not work
with bar plots for Seaborn â‰¤ v0.12.0. I recommend manually installing Seaborn v0.12.2 manually afterward using:

```
pip install seaborn==0.12.2
```

I would love contribute to the main Statannotations branch and bump it up to match the Seaborn updates, but it seems to
be a daunting challenge and will require time on my part. ðŸ¤žHopefully the main maintainers and
contributors can get to it sooner!ðŸ¤ž

## Tutorial

Documentation can be found [here](https://py50.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

A Jupyter Notebook demoing the code can be found [here](https://github.com/tlint101/py50/tree/main/tutorials).

# Web Application [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://py50-app.streamlit.app)

For those who are not versed in python coding, py50 has been converted into a web application using Streamlit!

The web application can be found here: [py50-app](https://py50-app.streamlit.app)

The repository for the Streamlit app version can be found
here: [py50-streamlit](https://github.com/tlint101/py50-streamlit)

**NOTE:** Updates to the web application take more time. As of this writing, the py50 Streamlit is running on version
0.3.6. Updates with statistics and plot annotations will be forthcoming.

## Future Work

With the release of py50 v1.0.0, I have finished a project that has been on my mind for the past six months. My aim now
will be to reformat the code for maintainability and to fix any bugs that I find or others report. I plan on maintaining
py50 for the foreseeable future. As such, my current "To-Do" list (in no particular order) are as follows:

- [ ] Complete To-Do notes in Python script
- [ ] Update Tutorials for clarity
- [X] Update py50 Streamlit to version 1.0.0
- [ ] Refactor code for maintainability
- [ ] **Add error messages!**
- [ ] (Bonus Points) Provide KNIME workflow?
