========

DeepXDE was developed by `Lu Lu <https://github.com/lululxvi>`_ under the supervision of Prof. `George Karniadakis <https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis>`_ at `Brown University <https://www.brown.edu>`_ from the summer of 2018 to 2020, supported by `PhILMs <https://www.pnnl.gov/computing/philms>`_. DeepXDE was originally self-hosted in Subversion at Brown University, under the name SciCoNet (Scientific Computing Neural Networks). On Feb 7, 2019, SciCoNet was moved from Subversion to GitHub, renamed to DeepXDE.

DeepXDE is currently maintained by `Lu Lu <https://github.com/lululxvi>`_ at `Yale University <https://www.yale.edu>`_ with major contributions coming from many talented individuals in various forms and means. A non-exhaustive but growing list needs to mention: `Paul Escapil-Inchausp√© <https://github.com/pescap>`_, `Jialin Li <https://github.com/lijialin03>`_, `Saransh Chopra <https://github.com/Saransh-cpp>`_, `Zongren Zou <https://github.com/ZongrenZou>`_, `Sensen He <https://github.com/HydrogenSulfate>`_, `Zhongyi Jiang <https://github.com/Jerry-Jzy>`_, `Anran Jiao <https://github.com/anranjiao>`_, `Shunyuan Mao <https://github.com/smao-astro>`_.
