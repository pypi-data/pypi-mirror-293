# Widget Development
This section provides an introduction to the building blocks of BEC Widgets: widgets. Widgets are the basic components of the graphical user interface (GUI) and are used to create larger applications. We will cover key topics such as how to develop new widgets or how to customise existing widgets. For details on the already available widgets and their usage, please refer to user section about [widgets](#user.widgets)
