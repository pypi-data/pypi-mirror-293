# Connect to a database
conn = client.connect_tenant(tenant_name='client1')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query to fetch all rows from a table
results = cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM your_table_name').fetchall()

# Print the results
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```
