# Ledoc_ui_bundle

This package only contains static files for ledoc_ui as a bundle.

It is intended to be used as a python package dependency for any webserver that serves UI for `openapi.json`.

As long as the `openapi.json` in standard format is served at `/openapi.json` path, the UI will work out of the box.
