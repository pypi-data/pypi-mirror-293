## Supervised Learning - Usage

This section demonstrates how to use the provided code for supervised learning tasks. Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the input data is paired with the correct output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs and can then make predictions on new, unseen data.

Below is a demo example of how to set up and train a supervised learning model using this codebase. The example uses synthetic data that reaches 100% accuracy and is intended to provide an initial introduction to the manager class. For more complex cases, please refer to the repository [auto-mind-examples](https://github.com/lucasbasquerotto/auto-mind-examples).

## Supervised Learning - Manager Class

The `Manager` class is responsible for orchestrating the training, validation, and testing of machine learning models. It can also be used to evaluate an already trained model. It integrates various components such as data loaders, models, optimizers, and metrics to provide a streamlined interface for supervised learning tasks.

The `Executor` is a component used to run a batch of data through the model. It is responsible for executing the forward pass of the model with the given input data and returning the output. The `Executor` can be customized to handle different types of input and output processing, making it versatile for various tasks

For example, the [GeneralBatchExecutor](/src/auto_mind/supervised/_action_handlers.py#L120) is the simplest case: it implements the `run` method to pass the input data to the model and return the model's output. The executor of the [NLP From Scratch: Classifying Names with a Character-Level RNN](https://github.com/lucasbasquerotto/auto-mind-examples/blob/main/supervised/char_rnn_classification.ipynb) example process the model output along with a `hidden` tensor during the iterations over the input tokens.

The executor has no access to the targets. If the targets are required during training, create a dataloader that returns them along with the inputs in the first element of a 2-element tuple, with the dataloader returning data in the form `(batch[(input, target)], batch[target])`. However, this approach is generally advised against in most scenarios to avoid data leaks during training. More frequently, you might want to use data that is part of the target but not the entire target, returning from the dataloader as `(batch[(input, target_in)], batch[target_out])`. The `batch` must be a sized object (that can be called with `len()`, such as a list or a `Tensor`), where the number of items corresponds to the batch size (the dataloader must conform to this specification).

The [TorchVision Object Detection Finetuning Tutorial](https://github.com/lucasbasquerotto/auto-mind-examples/blob/main/supervised/torchvision_tutorial.ipynb) provides an example of a custom evaluator that receives the inputs and targets used to train the model.

The manager expects a single model. If more than one model is trained for a task, they should be included as components of a larger model. The manager also expects a single optimizer, and an [OptimizerChain](/src/auto_mind/supervised/_action_handlers.py#L80) can be used to allow several optimizers.

The example [NLP From Scratch: Translation with a Sequence to Sequence Network and Attention](https://github.com/lucasbasquerotto/auto-mind-examples/blob/main/supervised/seq2seq_translation.ipynb), from the examples repository, has the encoder and decoder used together in the `EncoderDecoder` model class, and an optimizer chain with both the encoder and decoder optimizers.

The criterion passed to the manager is the loss function and can either be a torch module that receives the output (returned by the `run()` method of the executor) and the target batch from the dataloader, or a function that expects a single parameter of type [BatchInOutParams](/src/auto_mind/supervised/_action_data.py#L531) that has properties related to the input, target, and the output of the executor, and should return a tensor. The function form is useful if you want to use the batch input, which is not passed to the module class (this requirement should be rare).

The `Evaluator` is an important component used to leverage the model for various tasks. For instance, if you want `manager.evaluate(input)` to return the string of a category based on an input that is the URL of an image, you can create an evaluator that performs the following steps: loads the image from the URL, converts it into a tensor, passes the tensor to the model, retrieves the category index from the model's output tensor, and then maps the index to the category name to return it. The `Evaluator` is versatile and not necessarily focused on performance assessment; it can handle a wide range of tasks involving model usage, including preprocessing inputs and post-processing outputs. It can even be used in scenarios where the goal is to just print or plot results rather than return a value. That said, the `Evaluator` is an optional component, and any actions can be performed on the trained model by calling `manager.load_model()` method first and using the model.

An example of a custom evaluator can be seen in the [Transfer Learning for Computer Vision Tutorial](https://github.com/lucasbasquerotto/auto-mind-examples/blob/main/supervised/transfer_learning.ipynb). In this tutorial, the input is a string representing the path of an image. The evaluator displays the image along with the predicted class given by the model. Note that the method does not return any value.

Both training and testing can use an `EarlyStopper` to determine if the process should be stopped. There are two types of early stoppers:

1. **General EarlyStopper**: This can be used in both training and testing. It should implement the `check(self) -> bool` method of the `EarlyStopper` base class to verify if the process should be temporarily stopped. This temporary stop will cease the entire process and return a partial result. The training can be continued later. This is useful for stopping a long-running process to release some resources and continue in the future, for example.

2. **TrainEarlyStopper**: This is specific to training and behaves similarly to the general early stopper but with additional functionality. It should implement the `check_finish(self) -> bool` method to stop the process completely, considering that it has ended. It should also implement `update_epoch(self, loss, accuracy, metrics)` to update the state with metrics related to the epoch (to be able to determine if it should stop). Additionally, it should implement `state_dict(self) -> dict` and `load_state_dict(self, state_dict) -> typing.Self` to manage the state of the early stopper and allow the persistence of the state even if the run is interrupted. The loss and accuracy considered are the validation metrics if the training includes a validation step; otherwise, the training metrics are used.

One example of a `TrainEarlyStopper` is the [AccuracyEarlyStopper](/src/auto_mind/supervised/_action_handlers.py#L54), which stops and finishes the training after the accuracy meets or exceeds a minimum threshold consecutively across a specified number of epochs. You can use more than one early stopper (either a basic `EarlyStopper`, a `TrainEarlyStopper`, or a combination of both) by passing them to the constructor of [ChainedEarlyStopper](/src/auto_mind/supervised/_action_handlers.py#L26).
