The Great Tables crew is excited to share that we'll be presenting on tables at PyCon 2024!
If you're around and want to meet, be sure to stop by the Posit Booth, or reach out on linkedin to [Rich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-iannone-a5640017/) or [Michael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-a-chow/)!

The talk, Making Beautiful, Publication Quality Tables is Possible in 2024 is [10:45am Friday](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/65/).

In addition to the talk, there are two other events worth mentioning:

* The [2024 Table Contest](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-the-2024-table-contest/)
* Our [upcoming table workshop](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf24/publiccatalog/page/publiccatalog/session/1707334049004001S0l2) at posit::conf 2024

## What's the presentation about?

Publication quality tables are a critical form of data visualization, that is easy to miss in
favor of charts and graphs. We're excited to focus on how...

* tables are used in areas like sports and medicine.
* Great Tables provides a systematic approach to structuring, styling, and formatting tables.
* nanoplots combine the trend-emphasizing of graphs with the compactness of a table.

Throughout the presentation, we'll focus on making this example from a fictitious coffee device shop ([notebook](https://github.com/machow/coffee-sales-data/blob/main/example_notebook.ipynb)):

<div style="zoom: .80">

{{< include table.html >}}

</div>

Each row of this table is a product sold over the past year (with a total at the bottom).

Note three important pieces:

1. **Icons** help people quickly identify products of interest.
2. **Background color** distinguishes between revenue and profit measures.
3. **The nanoplot** on the right shows a tiny bargraph for monthly sales over the past year.  This makes
   it easy to spot trends, and can be hovered over to get exact values.

Critically, the code for this table used the DataFrame library [Polars](https://pola.rs/), which
makes it really [easy to select rows and columns for styling](../polars-styling).


## What's next?

### The 2024 Table Contest

The world's premier display table contest---the [4th annual Table Contest](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-the-2024-table-contest/) draws competitors from near and far,
to showcase the latest and greatest examples in table presentation.
The contest is happening now, with **submissions due by May 31st, 2024**.

For inspiration, see these resources:

* [Contest announcement](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-the-2024-table-contest/)
* [2022 winners and honorable mentions](https://posit.co/blog/winners-of-the-2022-table-contest/)


### posit::conf() workshop

We're planning a posit::conf() 2024 workshop in August, called [Making Tables with gt and Great Tables](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf24/publiccatalog/page/publiccatalog/session/1707334049004001S0l2).

If you're curious about making beautiful, publication quality tables in Python or R, we'd love to have you!

Weâ€™ll cover the following:

* Create table components and put them together (e.g., header, footer, stub, etc.)
* Format cell values (numeric/scientific, date/datetime, etc.)
* Rearranging columns and handling column value alignments
* Styling the table, either through data values or on a more granular level
* Adding icons, plots, images, and incorporating your own HTML
* and more!

## Extra resources

## Hope all your tables are great!

A huge thanks to all the people who have contributed to Great Tables over the past year.
It's been a really incredible journey.
Hope to see you at PyCon 2024!
