## Adding support for your university

In order to support your university, some information is first needed.



### Necessary data to add support

In summary, the following information is needed:

- **University name** (e.g. *University of Central Lancashire*).
- **Short name** or abbreviation (e.g. *UCLan*).

- **Link to Blackboard portal** (e.g. *https://portal.uclan.ac.uk*).
- **Landing URL** after successfully logging in (e.g. *https://portal.uclan.ac.uk/ultra*).



> There are [other fields](#advanced-fields) you can collect but I strongly suggest you skip these

## Footnotes



#### Advanced fields

- **Valid Blackboard data sources**

This is a tricky one because it can potentially help filter out dummy courses and other folders with no user content.

However, its usage may vary per institution, ultimately is not necessary, and if set incorrectly it may cause other users to not see any course at all.

You are fine without it and it is suggested to be skipped. If you have more information about how these are set internally, please let me know.

> To know this, you'll need to login to blackboard on a browser, and then visit the
> endpoint "/learn/api/public/v1/users/me/courses" on your university blackboard page.
> For instance, this might be: "https://portal.uclan.ac.uk/learn/api/public/v1/users/me/courses".
>
> Once on this page, you will see the list of courses you are registered for. Entries are of this form:

> ```json
> {
>   "id":"...",
>   "userId":"...",
>   "courseId":"...",
>   "dataSourceId":"_21_1",
>   "created":"...",
>   "modified":"...",
>   "availability":{"available":"Yes"},
>   "courseRoleId":"Student",
>   "lastAccessed":"..."
> }
> ```

>  Check the dataSourceId for all the entries returned and note down the one that appears most.

- **Possible `isp` and `org` fields** that would indicate a connection from an IP that belongs to the university.

In future releases, it might be possible to optimise the setup process by automatically detecting connections from a university ISP.

This, however, is yet to be implemented, and I would like to know your thoughts about it.

> Visit http://ip-api.com/json?fields=org,isp from an IP belonging to the institution and record those values.
