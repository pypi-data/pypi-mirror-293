Selective Copying
##
Choose a specific file to overwrite another in multiple directories

```python
import sage

# overwrites the entered filename (basement.png) in the renovated_kitchen folder with the file in kitchen_catelog folder

sage.batch_file_overwrite(./kitchen_catelog, ./renovated_kitchen, "basement.png")

```


Batch Operations
##
Perform operations on multiple directories

```python
import sage

# only copies 10 folders that are in the kitchen_catelog that share the same folder names as those in the old_kitchen folder in the renovated_kitchen folder

sage.copy_num_folders(./old_kitchen, ./kitchen_catelog, ./renovated_kitchen, 10)

# only copies folders that are in the kitchen_catelog that share the same folder names as those in the old_kitchen folder in the renovated_kitchen folder

sage.copy_folders(./old_kitchen, ./kitchen_catelog, ./renovated_kitchen)

```
