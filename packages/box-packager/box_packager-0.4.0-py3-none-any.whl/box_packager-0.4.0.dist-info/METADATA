The goal of this package is
to provide a command line interface
that allows you to easily package your existing python project
with [`PyApp`](https://ofek.dev/pyapp/).

Currently, `box` only support python projects that have their metadata stored in a `pyproject.toml` file.
See [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#writing-pyproject-toml)
for details.

**Note**:
This package is still in a very early
development phase! Please report your findings and issues,
so that we can improve this tool together.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://box.readthedocs.io/)
for further information on installation and usage.
