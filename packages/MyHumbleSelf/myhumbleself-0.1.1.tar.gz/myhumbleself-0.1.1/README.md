**Quick start:**

- Launch MyHumbleSelf
- Resize the window and move it to the desired location
- Set it to "always on top" via your window manager (right-click on titlebar)
- Hover the webcam image and click the "eye"-button on top right to hide the window
  controls

**Some notable features:**

- Choose from a variety of shape-masks to add some style

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1) How can I display my webcam stream in MyHumbleSelf _and_ in a video conferencing
tool at the same time?**

You can use [v4l2loopback](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback) to create a virtual
webcam that you can access by multiple applications at the same time.

**2) What should I do if I need more features?**

If you think it is an important basic feature, open a
[feature request](https://github.com/dynobo/myhumbleself/issues/new). Otherwise,
consider using a tool like [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), which is much more
powerful (but a bit more difficult to use).

## Contributing

You are very welcome to contribute to this project! However, before you invest a lot of
time in a contribution, it might be worth
[sharing your idea in advance](https://github.com/dynobo/myhumbleself/issues) to avoid
an unnecessary disappointment.

### Development Setup

**Prerequisites:** <a name="prerequisites"></a>

- Python 3.12+
- GTK 4.6+ and related dev packages:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install \
     libgirepository1.0-dev \
     libcairo2-dev \
     python3-gi \
     gobject-introspection \
     libgtk-4-dev
  ```

**Setup your version of the repository:**

1. [Fork the project's repository](https://github.com/dynobo/myhumbleself/fork).
2. Copy your fork to the local file system: \
   `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/myhumbleself.git`

**Setup Virtual Environment:**

1. Navigate into the repository root directory: \
   `cd myhumbleself`
2. Create the virtual environment: \
   `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the environement: \ `source .venv/bin/activate`

**Install dependencies:**

1. Install the package, it's dependencies, and development dependencies in editable
   mode: \
   `pip install -e '.[dev]'`
2. Verify installation by launching MyHumbleSelf: \
   `python myhumbleself/app.py`

**Run checks and tests:**

1. Run all project checks locally, to verify a correct setup of the dev environment: \
   `pre-commit run --all-files`
2. You should run those checks before doing any `git commit` to ensure your change
   doesn't break anything. You can do this automatically by installing them as git hook:
   \
   `pre-commit install`

## Design Principles

- **No network connection**<br>Everything should run locally without any network
  communication.
- **Simplicity**<br>Focus on key features. Keep the UI simple. Avoid text in the UI if
  possible.
- **Dependencies**<br>The less dependencies, the better.
