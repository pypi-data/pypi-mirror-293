# Windrak

## Project Name
Windrak is a CLI tool for advanced file operations with LLM capabilities.

## Brief Description
Windrak is designed to simplify the process of creating and managing README files for projects. It uses a combination of natural language processing to generate high-quality README content.

## Main Features
* Generate expert-level README files for projects
* Support for multiple sections, including project description, main features, prerequisites, installation, usage, examples, project structure, API reference, contribution guidelines, troubleshooting, changelog, license, and contact information
* Integration with LLM capabilities for generating high-quality content

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.7+
* Groq API key

## Installation
To install Windrak, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install windrak
```

After installation, you need to set up your Groq API key as an environment variable. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal, replacing "your-groq-api-key" with your actual API key:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

## Usage
To generate a README file for your project, use the following command:
```bash
windrak create-readme --path /path/to/your/project --output README.md
```
Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory, and `README.md` with the desired output file name.

## Examples
Here are some examples of using Windrak:

* Generate a README file for a project in the current directory:
  ```bash
  windrak create-readme --path . --output README.md
  ```
* Generate a README file for a project in a specific directory:
  ```bash
  windrak create-readme --path /path/to/your/project --output README.md
  ```
* Generate a README file with custom sections:
  ```bash
  windrak create-readme --path . --output README.md --sections "1. Project Name, 2. Brief Description, 3. Main Features"
  ```

## API Reference
Windrak uses the Groq API for generating README content. You can find more information about the Groq API at [https://groq.com/](https://groq.com/).
