    Hyperspace is a cloud search database that leverages cloud hardware to enhance search speed and relevancy. Hyperspace uses a Search Processing Unit (SPU) virtual chipâ€”a domain-specific architecture optimized for search tasks, to provide unmatched performance for real-time applications at scale, maintaining cost efficiency without compromising over logic complexity.             Hyperspace is a managed SaaS solution, combining hardware-level speed with software-level flexibility and designed to support a wide range of AI applications such as real-time recommendations, fraud prevention, Ad-tech, RAG, and threat detection.
