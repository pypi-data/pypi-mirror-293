# NB: please avoid putting environment specific rules here.  Many of these settings can be put in
# ${HOME}/.config/git/ignore (aka ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/git/config, Windows users perhaps try AppData\Local?) -- then they
# apply to all projects on your local workstation.
#
# Examples:
# - vi swapfiles (*.sw?, .*.sw?)
# - IntelliJ IDEA project (.idea/)
# - VisualStudio Code project (.vscode/)
#
# See https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore for further detail.

# Distribution generated files
/dist/

# Build system generated files
/build/

# Ignore Python cache directories
__pycache__/

# Ignore project coverage
/.coverage

# Ignore tox working directory
/.tox/

# Ignore "egg info" directories (or files, if someone makes such an abomination)
*.egg-info
