## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- PostgreSQL installed on your local machine or accessible remotely

### Installation

Install Blitzkrieg using pip to get started with simplifying your project setups:

```bash
pip install blitzkrieg
```

### Usage

1. **Creating a Blitzkrieg Workspace**
To initialize Blitzkrieg on your local:
```bash
blitz create workspace <workspace_name>
```

This sets up your workspace database and workspace pgadmin instance, as well as your workspace directory - so that Blitzkrieg can manage your projects and databases. The ```workspace_name``` can be an organization name, first and last name, etc.

2. **cd Into New Workspace**
```bash
cd <workspace_name>
```

3. **Create a New CLI Tool**
```bash
blitz create project <project_name>
```

4. **cd Into New Project**
```bash
cd <project_name>
```

5. **Release Project**
```bash
blitz release <project_name>
```

7. (side quest) **Deleting a Blitzkrieg Workspace:** To delete a workspace, simply enter into the CLI:
```bash
blitz delete <workspace_name>
```

#### Synchronizing Issues and Documentation
To ensure all your issues are up-to-date across blitzkrieg, your local host directory, and github issues:

```bash
blitz sync
```

This will update your project management tools and local documentation to reflect the latest changes and issues.

## Vision for the Future
Blitzkrieg is not just a project initialization toolâ€”it's evolving into an intelligent context-aware development environment. Future enhancements will focus on:

- **Advanced AI Integration**: Automating more complex aspects of software development, including code generation and issue resolution based on AI learning from project data.
- **Project Extrapolation**: Using inputs from initial project descriptions to automatically generate detailed project roadmaps and, ultimately tickets/issues.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Automation**: Fully automating the CI/CD pipelines, enabling seamless deployments directly from the development environment.

## Stages of Blitzkrieg Development

Blitzkrieg is designed to evolve through several stages, each enhancing its capabilities to manage and automate software development projects with increasing sophistication. Below, we outline the stages and their functionalities:

### **Stage 1: Basic Automation**
**Objective**: Automate foundational aspects of software project management.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Project Initialization**: Automates the setup of development environments, including repositories, databases, and basic configurations.
  - **Documentation Synchronization**: Ensures that documentation is automatically updated whenever there are changes in the codebase, maintaining consistency.
- **How It Works**: At this stage, Blitzkrieg uses scripts and integration tools to perform tasks that are typically repetitive and time-consuming, freeing up developers to focus on more complex issues.

### **Stage 2: Intelligent Project Management**
**Objective**: Enhance project management by introducing adaptive workflows and predictive analytics.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Task Management**: Automatically manages tasks based on project progress and developer interactions.
  - **Predictive Analytics**: Uses historical data to predict issues and optimize project timelines and resource allocation.
- **How It Works**: Blitzkrieg integrates machine learning models that analyze past project data to provide insights and automate decisions, such as adjusting timelines or reallocating resources based on predicted needs.

### **Stage 3: Autonomous Software Creation**
**Objective**: Enable Blitzkrieg to autonomously create and modify software components.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Code Generation**: Automatically generates code snippets or modules based on project requirements.
  - **Self-Optimization**: Modifies its own operational algorithms to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
- **How It Works**: This stage employs advanced AI techniques, including deep learning, to generate and refine code. It also allows Blitzkrieg to self-assess its algorithms and make adjustments to optimize its performance.

### **Stage 4: Strategic AI Partner**
**Objective**: Transform Blitzkrieg into a strategic partner capable of undertaking significant business and development initiatives autonomously.
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Strategic Planning**: Interprets high-level business goals and develops software strategies to achieve them.
  - **Business Initiative Automation**: Autonomously launches new projects or ventures to meet strategic objectives.
- **How It Works**: At this stage, Blitzkrieg leverages sophisticated NLP and strategic decision-making algorithms to understand abstract concepts and long-term goals. It then autonomously plans and executes projects that align with these goals.

### **Progression and Integration**
Each stage builds upon the previous one, allowing Blitzkrieg to gradually take on more responsibility and operate with greater independence. The transition between stages involves careful monitoring and fine-tuning to ensure that each new capability integrates seamlessly with existing functionalities.
