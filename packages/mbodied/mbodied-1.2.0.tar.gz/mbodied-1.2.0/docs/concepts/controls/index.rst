Controls
==================

Overview
^^^^^^^^^

``Controls`` are the final processed command signals sent to downstream applications, translating agent outputs into actionable commands.

**Examples:**

- **Language Controls**: These could be commands executed through text, such as sending an email or triggering a script.

- **Motion Control**: These involve movements, like directing a robotic arm along a specific trajectory in joint space, which describes the configuration of joints rather than positions in space.
