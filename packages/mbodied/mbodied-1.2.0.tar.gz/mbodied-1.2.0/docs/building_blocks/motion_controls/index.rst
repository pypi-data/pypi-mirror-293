^^^^^^^^^^^

The `controls <https://github.com/mbodiai/embodied-agents/blob/main/mbodied/types/motion_controls.py>`_ module defines various motions to control a robot as Pydantic models. They are also subclassed from ``Sample``, thus possessing all the capability of ``Sample`` as mentioned above. These controls cover a range of actions, from simple joint movements to complex poses and full robot control.
