## Light Recurrent Unit - Pytorch

Implementation of the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/16/3204">Light Recurrent Unit</a> in Pytorch

## Install

```bash
$ pip install light-recurrent-unit-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from light_recurrent_unit_pytorch import LightRecurrentUnitCell

cell = LightRecurrentUnitCell(256)

x = torch.randn(2, 256)
hidden = torch.randn(2, 256)

next_hidden = cell(x, hidden) # (2, 256)
```

Single layer

```python
import torch
from light_recurrent_unit_pytorch import LightRecurrentUnitLayer

layer = LightRecurrentUnitLayer(256)

x = torch.randn(2, 1024, 256)

out = layer(x) # (2, 1024, 256)

assert out.shape == x.shape
```

Stacked

```python
import torch
from light_recurrent_unit_pytorch import LightRecurrentUnit

lru = LightRecurrentUnit(256, depth = 4)

x = torch.randn(2, 1024, 256)

out = lru(x) # (2, 1024, 256)

assert out.shape == x.shape
```
