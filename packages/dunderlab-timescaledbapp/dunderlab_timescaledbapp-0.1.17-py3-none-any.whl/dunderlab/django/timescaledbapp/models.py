Timescaledbapp Models
======================

This module provides the Django models for the timescaledbapp.

Models
------

.. rubric:: Source

Represents the source of a measurement. Each source has an ID, a name, a
location, a device, a protocol, a version, a description, and a timestamp
indicating when it was created.

.. rubric:: Measure

Represents a measure taken by a source. Each measure has a label, a name, a
description, and is linked to a specific source.

.. rubric:: Channel

Represents a channel of a measure. Each channel has a label, a name, a unit, a
sampling rate, a description, is linked to a specific measure, and has a count
of the number of times it has been used.

.. rubric:: Chunk

Represents a chunk of a measure. Each chunk has a label and is linked to a
specific measure.

.. rubric:: TimeSerie

Represents a time series data point. Each data point has a timestamp, a value,
is linked to a specific channel and chunk.

Each of these models corresponds to a table in the database, and each attribute
of a model corresponds to a field in the table. The relationships between the
models (such as the ForeignKey fields) represent database relationships (such
as foreign key constraints).
