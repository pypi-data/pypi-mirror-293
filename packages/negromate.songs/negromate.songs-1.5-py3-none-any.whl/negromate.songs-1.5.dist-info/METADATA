Negro Mate Songs
================
[Negro Mate](https://negromate.rocks)'s song database library. Not very versatile without two another packages:

 * [negromate.web](https://pypi.org/project/negromate.web/): Static html compiler for the web of Negro Mage
 * [negromate.karaoke](https://pypi.org/project/negromate.karaoke/): Simple karaoke video browser

Provides the base `negromate` command to interact with a song repository.

    negromate config: Write the configuration file
    negromate songs: Update song database
    negromate thumbnail: Generate cover and thumbnail for a song

Needs the following packages installed:

 * imagemagick
 * ffmpeg

Karaoke subtitle generation is currently broken, it worked with these
packages on older systems:

 * xdotool
 * aegisub
 * xserver-xephyr


## Song library structure

Each song is a folder containing at least a video file, a subtitles file and a metadata file:

    song_name/
    ├── song_name.ass
    ├── song_name.mp4
    └── metadata.json

Video and subtitles file has to be named like the folder. Supported subtitles:

 * ass (prefered)
 * src
 * vtt

### The metadata json file

    {
        "name": "Song name",
        "original": "Original song, Original author",
        "karaoke": true,
        "date": "XXXX-XX-XX"
        "author": "Author of the karaoke"
    }


* `name`: used as the title of the song.
* `original`: for giving credit to original authors.
* `karaoke`: if `true`, the ass subtitles file has karaoke level subtitles (syllable level timing)
  and automatik karaoke subtitles can be generated.
* `date`: approx. creation date of this version
* `author`: not required, used for givin credits to the author when it's different from the web authors.
