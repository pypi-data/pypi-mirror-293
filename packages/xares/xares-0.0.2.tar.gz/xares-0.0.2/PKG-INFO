              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

X-ARES: eXtensive Audio Representation and Evaluation Suite

**This project is still in the early stage of development and welcomes contributions, especially in expanding supported tasks and improving robustness.**

## Introduction

X-ARES is a toolkit for training, evaluating, and exporting audio encoders for various audio tasks. It is heavily inspired by the [HEAR benchmark](https://hearbenchmark.com/).

## Planned supported tasks

Currently, only four tasks (ESC-50, VocalSound, CREMA-D and LibriSpeech-Male-Female) have been implemented. However, adding new tasks is straightforward: it typically only need to implement the audio data download and packaging functions, as manual audio decoding and training implementations are not necessary. We encourage anyone to submit pull requests to expand the set of supported tasks.

### Speech

- Speech Commands V1
- Speech Commands V2
- LibriCount
- VoxLingua107
- VoxCeleb1
- LibriSpeech-Male-Female
- LibriSpeech-Phoneme
- Fluent Speech Commands
- VocalSound
- CREMA-D
- RAVDESS
- ASV2015
- DiCOVA
- speechocean762

### Environment

- ESC-50
- FSD50k
- UrbanSound 8k

## Installation

X-ARES is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/xares/). You can install it via pip.

```bash
pip install xares
```

For development, you can clone the repository and install the package in editable mode.

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd xares
pip install -e .[examples]
```

## Run with the baseline pretrained audio encoder (Dasheng)

The ESC-50 task is used as an example.

```python
from example.dasheng.dasheng_encoder import DashengEncoder
from tasks.esc50 import esc50_task

task = esc50_task.ESC50Task(env_root="./env", encoder=DashengEncoder())

task.run_all()
```

## Run with your own pretrained audio encoder

An example of audio encoder wrapper could be found at `example/dasheng/dasheng_encoder.py`. It is very simple because the "dasheng" model is already in the required in/out format.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dasheng import dasheng_base
from xares.audio_encoder_base import AudioEncoderBase


@dataclass
class DashengEncoder(AudioEncoderBase):
    model = dasheng_base()
    sampling_rate = 16_000
    output_dim = 768

    def __call__(self, audio, sampling_rate):
        # Since the "dasheng" model is already in the required in/out format, we directly use the super class method
        return super().__call__(audio, sampling_rate)
```

Another example could be found at `example/wav2vec2/wav2vec2.py`. It is more complex, you need to covert the input audio and the encoded embedding to the required format.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from transformers import Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor, Wav2Vec2Model
from xares.audio_encoder_base import AudioEncoderBase


@dataclass
class Wav2vec2Encoder(AudioEncoderBase):
    output_dim = 768

    def __post_init__(self):
        self.feature_extractor = Wav2Vec2FeatureExtractor.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h")
        self.model = Wav2Vec2Model.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h")

    def __call__(self, audio, sampling_rate):
        input_values = (
            self.feature_extractor(
                self.pre_process_audio(audio, sampling_rate), sampling_rate=self.sampling_rate, return_tensors="pt"
            )
            .input_values.squeeze()
            .to(self.device)
        )

        encoded_audio = self.encode_audio(input_values)["last_hidden_state"]

        if not self.check_encoded_audio(encoded_audio):
            raise ValueError("Invalid encoded audio")

        return self.encoded_audio
```

## Add your own task

To add a new task, refer to existing task implementations for guidance. Essentially, create a task class that inherits from `TaskBase` and implements the `make_audio_tar` method tailored to your chosen dataset, handling data download, preprocessing, and packaging into the required format.
