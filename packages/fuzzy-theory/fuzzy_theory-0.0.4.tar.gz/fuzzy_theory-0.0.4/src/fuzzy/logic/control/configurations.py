    """
    The shape that a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) or Neuro-Fuzzy Network (NFN) should follow in
    their calculations. This is a named tuple that contains the (number of input variables, number
    of input variable terms, number of fuzzy logic rules, number of output variable, number of
    output variable terms) in that exact order.

    This is used to ensure that the FLC or NFN is built correctly and that the KnowledgeBase
    contains the correct number of fuzzy sets. The choice to put variables first and then terms
    comes from this is how fuzzy sets operate in the library, so this applies even for the output
    variable, though it might be more accurate for the output term layer to occur before the output
    variable layer.

    Example:
    ```
    shape = Shape(2, 3, 100, 1, 5)
    ```

    This shape represents a FLC with 2 input variables, each with 3 terms, 100 rules, 1 output
    variable with 5 terms.
