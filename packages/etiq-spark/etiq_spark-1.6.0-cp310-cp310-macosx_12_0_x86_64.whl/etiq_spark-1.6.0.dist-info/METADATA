# ETIQ AI

Etiq helps companies test and monitor ML models. For data science & ML teams,
Etiq tests ML algorithms, identifying issues and preventing accuracy loss in
both building & production stages. Etiq helps identify the following issue
types in the dataset/model: Bias, Data Leakage, Accuracy Issues, Drift, across
both pre-production and production stages. Additionally, Etiq helps identify
which segments are impacted by each issue type and provides modular tests
that you can plug at different points in your pipeline.
