# :droplet: Existenz API Fetcher

This package is designed to automate the loading and use of sensor data from the MeteoSwiss Federal Office's
and the Federal Office for the Environment's (FOEN) networks of stations and is built on top of Christian Studer's ExistenzAPIs (https://api.existenz.ch/).

Data is obtained by querying a two-year, daily time series from the InfluxDB database and is returned as a `pandas` dataframe.
Functions to compute potential evapotranspiration using the `pyet` module have been implemented.
Take a look at the Jupyter Notebooks tutorials in the examples directory to learn how to use the various functionalities of this package.

## Requirements
```
influxdb_client
pandas
pyet
folium
