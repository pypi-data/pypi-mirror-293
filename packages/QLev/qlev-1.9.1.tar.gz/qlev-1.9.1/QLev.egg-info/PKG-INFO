## Introduction
The QLev package is mainly used for:

* Levenshtein distance
* levenshtein distance normalized
* levenshtein distance considering the keyboard keys range 

## Requirements
* Python 3 or later

## Installation
```bash
pip install QLev
```

## Guide

To use simple the levenshtein distance you can:

```python
from QLev import levenshteinDistance

diff = levenshteinDistance('Guacamole','Guecamole')

print(diff)
```
If you want to use the normalized metric, you can:

```python
from QLev import levN

diff = levN('Guacamole','Guecamole')

print(diff)
```
If you want to know the euclidian distance between two chars, you can:

```python
from QLev import qwertyDistance

diff = qwertyDistance('g','a')

print(diff)
```

To have a metric that uses the qwerty matrix between strings, you can:

```python
from QLev import qwertyN

diff = qwertyN('Guacamole','Guecamole')

print(diff)
```

To have a metric that uses levenshtein distance and the qwerty matrix between strings, you can:

```python
from QLev import QLev

diff = QLev('Guacamole','Guecamole')

print(diff)
```
