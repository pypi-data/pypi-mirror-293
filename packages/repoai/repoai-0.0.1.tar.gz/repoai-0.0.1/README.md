RepoAI is an innovative, AI-powered framework designed to repository content editing. By leveraging the power of AI, RepoAI aims to streamline development processes and boost productivity.

## Key Features

1. **AI-Assisted Repository Management**
   - Intelligent project structure generation
   - Automated file content creation and editing
   - Smart version control integration with Git

2. **Flexible LLM Integration with LiteLLM**
   - Support for hundreds of AI models
   - Seamless integration with popular providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and more
   - Tested extensively with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model

3. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Easy integration of custom workflows and tasks
   - Community-driven plugin ecosystem
   - Potential for agentic tools implementation

4. **Project-Aware Conversations**
   - Context-aware AI interactions based on your project structure
   - Intelligent code suggestions and explanations

5. **Markdown-Based Documentation**
   - Automated generation of project documentation
   - Easy-to-read project overviews and file contents

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**
   First, create and activate a conda environment:
```bash
   conda create -n repoai python=3.9
   conda activate repoai
```

   Then, install RepoAI:
```bash
   pip install repoai
```

2. **Configuration**
   Set up your API keys according to the LiteLLM documentation. You can export them in your terminal session:
```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key-here"
   # Add other API keys as needed, e.g.:
   # export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

3. **Usage Options**

   a. **Python Script**
   
   Create a Python script to use RepoAI programmatically:
```python
   from repoai import ProjectManager, initialize
   
   # Initialize RepoAI
   initialize()
   
  # TODO: Add examples here
```

   b. **Command-Line Interface** (Coming Soon)
   
   Use RepoAI directly from the terminal:
```bash
   repoai create --project_path <Path where you want to host the project>
   repoai edit --project_path <Path to the actual project>
   repoai report --project_path <Path to the actual project>
   repoai plugin
```
   Note: This CLI functionality is currently in development and will be available soon.

## Community and Collaboration

We believe in the power of community-driven development. Join us in shaping the future of AI-assisted coding:

- **Plugin Sharing**: Visit our [Plugin Marketplace](https://repoai.dev/plugins) to discover, share, and collaborate on custom plugins.
- **Contribute**: Help improve RepoAI by submitting pull requests, reporting bugs, or suggesting new features on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cdgaete/repoai).
- **Discord Community**: Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ee88tmwHmR) to connect with other developers, share ideas, and get support.

## Customization and Extension

RepoAI is designed to be highly customizable and extensible:

1. **Custom Workflows**: Create your own workflows in the `dynamic_modules/workflows` directory.
2. **Task Development**: Implement custom tasks in the `dynamic_modules/tasks` directory to extend RepoAI's capabilities.
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Modify system prompts in the `prompts` directory to fine-tune AI behavior.

## Best Practices and Considerations

1. **Model Selection**: While RepoAI supports hundreds of models through LiteLLM, we recommend starting with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet for optimal performance.
2. **Security**: Always review AI-generated code before execution, especially when using powerful models or custom plugins.
3. **Version Control**: Regularly commit your changes and use branching strategies to maintain a clean project history.
4. **Documentation**: Encourage the AI to generate inline comments and documentation for better code maintainability.

## Future Roadmap

- Integration of agentic tools for more advanced automation
- Enhanced collaboration features for team-based development
- Improved code analysis and refactoring capabilities
- Support for additional programming languages and frameworks
- Full implementation of command-line interface for easier use

## Disclaimer

RepoAI is a powerful tool that can significantly enhance your development workflow. However, it's important to remember that AI-generated code should always be reviewed and tested thoroughly before deployment. While we strive for accuracy and reliability, the responsibility for the final code quality and functionality lies with the developer.

Join us in revolutionizing the way we manage repositories and write code. With RepoAI, the future of AI-assisted development is here today!
