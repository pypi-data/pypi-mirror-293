"""
High-precision satellite propagation using Runga-Kutta methods for
differential equation solving

Force models are mostly pulled from Montenbruck & Gill:
https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-58351-3

The propagator can also compute the state transition matrix, meaning
position and velocity covariances can be propagated as well.

The default propagator uses a Runga-Kutta 9(8) integrator 
with coefficient computed by Verner:
https://www.sfu.ca/~jverner/

This works much better than lower-order Runga-Kutta solvers
such as Dormund-Prince, and I don't know why it isn't more
popular in numerical packages

This module includes a function to propagate a position and time directly,
and a convenience "satstate" object that represents satellite position, velocity,
and optionally covariance and can propagate itself to different times 

Forces included in the propagator:

1. Earth gravity with higher-order zonal terms
2. Sun, Moon gravity
3. Radiation pressure
4. Atmospheric drag: NRL-MISE 2000 density model, with option
   to include space weather effects (can be large)
