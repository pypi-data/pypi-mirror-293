# rocm-smi-exporter

Export rocm-smi metrics as prometheus metrics

## Design

* Raw metrics from devices are obtained with `pyrsmi` and copied code form `rocm_smi_lib`
  * Both are wrappers of rocm's C API to access device metrics
  * `pyrsmi` has pip release
  * `rocm_smi_lib` does not have pip release, so we copied code.
  * We suggest to have official [`rocm_smi_lib` release](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_smi_lib/issues/192)
* Device-to-pod mapping from Kublet [`node podresources API`](
  https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/23/kubelet-podresources-api-ga/).
  * The API's protobuf file and its dependencies are in [third-party](third-party) as submodules.
  * The generated Python code form the API's protobuf are copied to [src/github](src/github)
    for easier access. Also needed for [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) to recognize
    the code automatically.
* Raw metrics are converted into Prometheus format in python code.
  * The list of metrics matches the GPU metrics collected by [AMD SMI exporter](
    https://github.com/amd/amd_smi_exporter?tab=readme-ov-file#gpu-metrics).
* [Prometheus Python client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python) is used to run the http server.

## Build

Generate Python code for Kubelet podresources APIs:

```
# Generate protobuf python
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I=third-party/ --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. \
third-party/github.com/kubernetes/kubelet/pkg/apis/podresources/v1/api.proto \
third-party/github.com/gogo/protobuf/gogoproto/gogo.proto

cp github.com/gogo/protobuf/gogoproto/gogo_pb2_grpc.py \
src/github/com/gogo/protobuf/gogoproto/gogo_pb2_grpc.py

cp github.com/kubernetes/kubelet/pkg/apis/podresources/v1/api_pb2_grpc.py \
src/github/com/kubernetes/kubelet/pkg/apis/podresources/v1/api_pb2_grpc.py
```

Build Docker image:

```
# This is the version, should be identical to the version in pyproject.toml
VERSION=<version>
docker build . -t powerml/rocm-smi-exporter:${VERSION} --build-arg VERSION=${VERSION}

# Login with powerml repo in 1password and push to it
docker login
docker push powerml/rocm-smi-exporter:${VERSION}

# -v /opt:/opt is needed to make rocm runtime library available to container
docker run -d --rm --name=smi-exporter -p 9001:9001 \
--device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri --group-add video \
-v /opt:/opt -v /var/lib/kubelet:/var/lib/kubelet powerml/rocm-smi-exporter:${VERSION}

# You should see the ROCM_* prefixed metrics
curl localhost:9001/metrics
```

## Install

```
# Public Pypi package
pip install rocm-smi-exporter==0.0.1a6

# Private Docker image
powerml/rocm-smi-exporter:0.0.1a6
```

## Deploy exporter as systemd service for infrastructure monitoring

See [systemd](systemd)

## Integration with kube-prometheus-stack

**NOTE**: `powerml/rocm-smi-exporter:0.0.1a12` is a private image, you may need to build your own image from the pip package.

Assume there is already a
[kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack)
deployment on your kubernetes cluster. Verify that with:

```
helm list -n <namespace-of-kube-prometheus-stack>
```

### Deploy exporter daemonset

NOTE: You'll need to have the imagePullSecret to be able to pull `powerml/rocm-smi-exporter`.

See [ds.yaml](k8s/ds.yaml)

### Upgrade kube-prometheus-stack helm values to pick up metrics from the sidecar

In your `kube-prometheus-stack`'s values.yaml file, add the following `rocm-smi-exporter` to the
`prometheus.prometheusSpec.additionalScrapeConfigs` section. You can the location in the [example of official repo](
https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/847789a719d91dd13d30a6e9eaa530af897e3276/charts/kube-prometheus-stack/values.yaml#L3843).
An example is provided below.
```
# This is a sample configuration.
# Save this to values.yaml and upgrade with helm.
prometheus:
  prometheusSpec:
    additionalScrapeConfigs:
      - job_name: rocm-smi-exporter
        scrape_interval: 1s
        metrics_path: /metrics
        scheme: http
        kubernetes_sd_configs:
        - role: pod
        relabel_configs:
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_exporter]
          action: keep
          regex: rocm-smi
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]
          target_label: pod
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]
          target_label: namespace
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_node_name]
          target_label: node
        - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_ip]
          target_label: instance
```

Save the above yaml to `values.yaml` and upgrade your own helm release.
```
helm list -n <namespace>
```
You'll see the output like below:

Note down the release name and version, here they are `prometheus` and `61.3.0`.

Then upgrade the release with the command below:
```
helm upgrade <release-name> prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -f values.yaml --version <version>
```

### Verify in Grafana

Open Grafana, click `Explore -> Prometheus -> Select Metric -> ROCM_*`, you should see the captured metrics:
```
METRIC_GPU_UTIL = "ROCM_SMI_DEV_GPU_UTIL"
METRIC_GPU_MEM_TOTAL = "ROCM_SMI_DEV_GPU_MEM_TOTAL"
METRIC_GPU_MEM_USED = "ROCM_SMI_DEV_GPU_MEM_USED"
METRIC_GPU_MEM_UTIL = "ROCM_SMI_DEV_MEM_UTIL"
METRIC_GPU_POWER = "ROCM_SMI_DEV_POWER"
METRIC_GPU_CU_OCCUPANCY = "ROCM_SMI_DEV_CU_OCCUPANCY"
```

You can import [GPUs](GPUs_Grafana.json) Grafana Dashboard into your Grafana.

## Reference

* [Add args to systemd service](https://superuser.com/a/728962)
  * The python code accepts `--port` and other arguments
  * If needed, set its value when launching systemd service
* [amd/amd-smi-exporter](https://github.com/amd/amd_smi_exporter) is AMD’s “semi-official” exporter for collecting
  metrics from AMD devices: CPU/APU/GPU, **to us** it has a few major issues:
  * It’s not focused on GPU, so it may take much longer than we can wait for it to mature, and it will always
    take longer for any new features to be implemented.
  * It seems experimental, get no dedicated staffing from AMD
* [nvidia/dcgm-exporter](https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter) is the mature solution from NVIDIA;
  it’s focusing on GPUs, and already working
  * We use it as an template to architecture ROCm-smi-exporter, parts related to standard k8s features can be borrowed directly
