# Multi-Dimensional DRT Visualizer
This Python package allows users to visualize Directed Rooted Trees (DRTs) that represent various dimensions of data derived from event logs. It provides tools to create graphical representations of these multi-dimensional trees, enabling deeper insights into process behaviors and relationships. The diagrams are generated via [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org).


# Installation
This package runs under Python 3.9+, use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install.
```sh
pip install mddrt
```
To render and save generated diagrams, you will also need to install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org)

# Quickstart

### Format event log
Using `mddrt.log_formatter` you can format your own initial event log with the corresponding column names based on [pm4py](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de) standard way of naming logs columns.

The format dictionary to pass as argument to this function needs to have the following structure:
```py
{
    "case:concept:name": <Case Id>, # required
    "concept:name": <Activity Id>, # required
    "time:timestamp": <Timestamp>, # required
    "start_timestamp": <Start Timestamp>, # optional
    "org:resource": <Resource>, # optional
    "cost:total": <Cost>, # optional
}
```

Each value of the dictionary needs to match the corresponding column name of the initial event log. If `start_timestamp`, `org:resource` and `cost:total` are not present in your event log, you can leave its values as blank strings.

```py
import mddrt
import pandas as pd

raw_event_log = pd.read_csv("raw_event_log.csv")

format_dictionary = {
    "case:concept:name": "Case ID",
    "concept:name": "Activity",
    "time:timestamp": "Complete",
    "start_timestamp": "Start",
    "org:resource": "Resource",
    "cost:total": "Cost",
}

event_log = mddrt.log_formatter(raw_event_log, format_dictionary)

```
### Discover Multi-Dimensional DRT

```py
drt = mddrt.discover_multi_dimensional_drt(
    event_log,
    calculate_cost=True,
    calculate_time=True,
    calculate_flexibility=True,
    calculate_quality=True,
    group_activities=False,
)
```

### Automatic group of activities 
```py
grouped_drt = mddrt.group_drt_activities(drt)
```

### Get the DRT diagram string representation
```py
mddrt_string = mpdfg.get_multi_dimension_drt_string(
    multi_dimensional_drt,
    visualize_time=True,
    visualize_cost=True,
    visualize_quality=True,
    visualize_flexibility=True
)
```

### View the generated DRT diagram
Allows the user to view the diagram in interactive Python environments like Jupyter and Google Colab.

```py
mpdfg.view_multi_dimensional_drt(
    multi_dimensional_drt
    visualize_time=True,
    visualize_cost=True,
    visualize_quality=True,
    visualize_flexibility=True,
    node_measures=["total"], # accepts also "consumed" and "remaining"
    arc_measures=[], # accepts "avg", "min" and "max", or you can keep this argument empty
    format="svg" # Format value should be a valid image extension like 'jpg', 'png', 'jpeq' or 'webp
)
```
> **WARNING**
> Not all output file formats of Graphviz are available to display in environments like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

### Save the generated DRT diagram

```py
mpdfg.save_vis_multi_dimensional_drt(
    multi_dimensional_drt
    file_path="diagram",
    visualize_time=True,
    visualize_cost=True,
    visualize_quality=True,
    visualize_flexibility=True,
    node_measures=["total"], # accepts also "consumed" and "remaining"
    arc_measures=[], # accepts "avg", "min" and "max", or you can keep this argument empty
    format="svg", # or pdf, webp, svg, etc.
)
```
