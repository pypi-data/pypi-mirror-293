Description: 
        # stepshift
        
        Stepshift is a package that implements the stepshifting algorithm described in appendix A of  
        [Hegre et al. (2020)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022343320962157).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Stepshift is currently only distributed as a source distribution, which means
        that the end user needs a C compiler. This means that OSX users need to have
        Xcode installed on their system before proceeding. In addition, the numpy
        requirement is quite strict, since stepshift uses the Numpy C API via Cython.
        
        Install by running:
        
        ```
        pip install stepshift
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Stepshift has a module called `stepshift.views` which contains a class called
        `StepshiftedModels`. This class wraps the stepshifting procedure, exposing a
        simple, Scikit-Learn-like (but not equivalent) API. The model takes three
        arguments: A scikit learn estimator, a list containing integers, which denotes
        the steps, and a string variable which is the name of the dependent variable:
        
        ```
        from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
        from stepshift.views import StepshiftedModels
        
        mdl = StepshiftedModels(LogisticRegression(),[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],"outcome")
        ```
