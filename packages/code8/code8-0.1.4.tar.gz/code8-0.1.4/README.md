# code8

code8 is a dashboard to use LLMs to directly on your code files, save and load custom profiles with custom prompts and more.

## Installation

```python
pip install code8
```

## Usage

After installation, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```python
code8
```

This will open up a web browser with the code8 UI, allowing you configure settings
and select files to run the LLMs on.

After configuring the settings using "code8", you could continue using the tool
through the UI with "code8", or you could use it in your terminal:

```python
code8 example.py
```

this will run the tool directly from the terminal without having to use the UI.
