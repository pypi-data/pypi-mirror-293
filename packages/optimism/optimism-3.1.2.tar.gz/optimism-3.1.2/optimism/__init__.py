"""
This package init just imports everything from optimism.py, including
explicitly the version number (which otherwise would be skipped since it
starts with '_'). That way, importing optimism-the-package is the same as
importing optimism-the-file, except that private variables are not
exported by the package. So you can distribute the package OR just the
optimism.py file and both should work the same.

# Setuptools versions on Python 3.10 won't allow us to just import the
# version from optimism, but we want the version to be defined in that
# file so that a single-file distribution is equivalent to this packaged
# distribution. So we define a version here as well, but...
__version__ = "3.1.2"

# ...then we assert it matches so testing will catch it if I forget to
# keep them in sync before a release. T_T
