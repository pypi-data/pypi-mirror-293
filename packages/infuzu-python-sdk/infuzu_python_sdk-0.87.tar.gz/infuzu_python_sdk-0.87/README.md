# Clockwise Assignment Completion SDK

## Overview

### Description

This SDK provides a set of tools to manage assignments from Clockwise. Primarily, it allows you to fetch, represent, and mark assignments as complete.
### Features
- **Infuzu Authentication**: Represents authentication credentials for Infuzu with methods for signature generation.
- **Assignment Representation**: Represents an Assignment fetched from Clockwise.
- **Complete Assignment Representation**: Represents a completed assignment in Clockwise.
- **Fetch and Complete Assignments**: Functionality to retrieve and mark assignments as complete.
## Setup Instructions
**Install the Package using pip**:

   ```
   pip install infuzu-python-sdk
   ```
## Usage

### InfuzuCredentials Class
This class is used to represent authentication credentials for Infuzu.
   ```python
   from infuzu.auth import InfuzuCredentials

   credentials: InfuzuCredentials = InfuzuCredentials(secret_id="YOUR_SECRET_ID", secret_key="YOUR_SECRET_KEY")
   ```
Methods & Classmethods:
- `from_file(filepath: str) -> 'InfuzuCredentials'`: Create an `InfuzuCredentials` instance from a `JSON` file.
- `from_dict(data: dict[str, str]) -> 'InfuzuCredentials'`: Create an `InfuzuCredentials` instance from a dictionary.

### Clockwise Assignments
Working with Clockwise assignments involves fetching and completing tasks using the `Assignment` and `CompleteAssignment` classes. 

#### Fetch an Assignment
   ```python
   from infuzu.clockwise.assignments import get_assignment, Assignment

   # Fetch an assignment from Clockwise
   try:
       assignment: Assignment = get_assignment(credentials)
       print(f"Fetched assignment: {assignment}")
   except NoContentError:
       print("No assignments available at the moment.")
   ```

#### Completing an Assignment
   ```python
   from datetime import datetime
   from infuzu.clockwise.assignments import assignment_complete, CompleteAssignment
   from infuzu.clockwise.errors import NoContentError

   # Mark an assignment as complete
   try:
       assignment: Assignment = get_assignment(credentials)

       # Placeholder start and end datetimes for the assignment execution
       start_dt = datetime.utcnow()
       end_dt = datetime.utcnow()

       # Placeholder for your code to execute the assignment
       # -- Your code here --

       # You should capture the execution details and construct an APIResponse accordingly
       response = APIResponse(...)  # Replace with actual response data

       complete_assignment: CompleteAssignment = CompleteAssignment(
           assignment=assignment,
           start_datetime=start_dt,
           end_datetime=end_dt,
           response=response
       )

       assignment_complete(credentials, complete_assignment)
       print("Assignment marked as completed.")
   except NoContentError:
       print("No assignments available to complete.")
   ```

### Clockwise Rules
The SDK allows you to manage rules in Clockwise, including creating new rules, deleting existing ones, and retrieving execution logs.

#### Create a Rule
   ```python
   from infuzu.clockwise.rules import create_rule, Rule
   from infuzu.clockwise.utils.enums.api_calls import HttpMethod
   from datetime import timedelta

   rule: Rule = Rule(
       name="Daily Data Backup",
       url="https://api.yourcompany.com/data/backup",
       interval=timedelta(days=1),
       http_method=HttpMethod.POST
   )

   # Create the rule in Clockwise
   rule_id = create_rule(credentials, rule)
   print(f"Rule created with ID: {rule_id}")
   ```

#### Delete a Rule
   ```python
   from infuzu.clockwise.rules import delete_rule

   # Delete Rule by ID
   rule_deleted_success = delete_rule(credentials, rule_id="123456")
   if rule_deleted_success:
       print("Rule deleted successfully.")
   else:
       print("There was an error deleting the rule.")
   ```

#### Get Rule Execution Logs
   ```python
   from infuzu.clockwise.rules import get_rule_logs

   # Retrieve execution logs for a specific rule
   executions = get_rule_logs(credentials, rule_id="123456")
   for execution in executions:
       print(f"Execution details: {execution}")
   ```

## Important Note
Please handle your credentials securely and ensure you manage exceptions when dealing with API calls.
