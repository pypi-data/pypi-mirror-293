# Pinecore
Python package that helps to write well-architectured application and restructuring existing code from a mess into clean via design patterns and utilities. 

This package is written for my daily work of designing python backend for data processing and machine learning, so it is heavily designed based on graph and change data capture pattern.

The package can be installed from pypi
```bash
pip install pinecore
```
