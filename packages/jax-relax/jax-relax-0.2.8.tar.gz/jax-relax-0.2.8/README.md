## Overview

`ReLax` (**Re**course Explanation **L**ibrary in J**ax**) is an
efficient and scalable benchmarking library for recourse and
counterfactual explanations, built on top of
[jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). By leveraging language
primitives such as *vectorization*, *parallelization*, and
*just-in-time* compilation in
[jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), `ReLax` offers massive
speed improvements in generating individual (or local) explanations for
predictions made by Machine Learning algorithms.

Some of the key features are as follows:

- üèÉ **Fast and scalable** recourse generation.

- üöÄ **Accelerated** over `cpu`, `gpu`, `tpu`.

- ü™ì **Comprehensive** set of recourse methods implemented for
  benchmarking.

- üëê **Customizable** API to enable the building of entire modeling and
  interpretation pipelines for new recourse algorithms.

## Installation

``` bash
pip install jax-relax
# Or install the latest version of `jax-relax`
pip install git+https://github.com/BirkhoffG/jax-relax.git 
```

To futher unleash the power of accelerators (i.e., GPU/TPU), we suggest
to first install this library via `pip install jax-relax`. Then, follow
steps in the [official install
guidelines](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) to install the
right version for GPU or TPU.

## Dive into `ReLax`

`ReLax` is a recourse explanation library for explaining (any) JAX-based
ML models. We believe that it is important to give users flexibility to
choose how to use `ReLax`. You can

- only use methods implemeted in `ReLax` (as a recourse methods
  library);
- build a pipeline using `ReLax` to define data module, training ML
  models, and generating CF explanation (for constructing recourse
  benchmarking pipeline).

### `ReLax` as a Recourse Explanation Library

We introduce basic use cases of using methods in `ReLax` to generate
recourse explanations. For more advanced usages of methods in `ReLax`,
See this [tutorials](tutorials/methods.ipynb).

``` python
from relax.methods import VanillaCF
from relax import DataModule, MLModule, generate_cf_explanations, benchmark_cfs
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import functools as ft
import jax
```

Let‚Äôs first generate synthetic data:

``` python
xs, ys = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, random_state=42)
train_xs, test_xs, train_ys, test_ys = train_test_split(xs, ys, random_state=42)
```

Next, we fit an MLP model for this data. Note that this model can be any
model implmented in JAX. We will use the
[`MLModule`](https://birkhoffg.github.io/jax-relax/ml_model.html#mlmodule)
in `ReLax` as an example.

``` python
model = MLModule()
model.train((train_xs, train_ys), epochs=10, batch_size=64)
```

Generating recourse explanations are straightforward. We can simply call
`generate_cf` of an implemented recourse method to generate *one*
recourse explanation:

``` python
vcf = VanillaCF(config={'n_steps': 1000, 'lr': 0.05})
cf = vcf.generate_cf(test_xs[0], model.pred_fn)
assert cf.shape == test_xs[0].shape
```

Or generate a bunch of recourse explanations with `jax.vmap`:

``` python
generate_fn = ft.partial(vcf.generate_cf, pred_fn=model.pred_fn)
cfs = jax.vmap(generate_fn)(test_xs)
assert cfs.shape == test_xs.shape
```

### `ReLax` for Building Recourse Explanation Pipelines

The above example illustrates the usage of the decoupled `relax.methods`
to generate recourse explanations. However, users are required to write
boilerplate code for tasks such as data preprocessing, model training,
and generating recourse explanations with feature constraints.

`ReLax` additionally offers a one-liner framework, streamlining the
process and helping users in building a standardized pipeline for
generating recourse explanations. You can write three lines of code to
benchmark recourse explanations:

``` python
data_module = DataModule.from_numpy(xs, ys)
exps = generate_cf_explanations(vcf, data_module, model.pred_fn)
benchmark_cfs([exps])
```

See [Getting Started with
ReLax](https://birkhoffg.github.io/jax-relax/tutorials/getting_started.html)
for an end-to-end example of using `ReLax`.
