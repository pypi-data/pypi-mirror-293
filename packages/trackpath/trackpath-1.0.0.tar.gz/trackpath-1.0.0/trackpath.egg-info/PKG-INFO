## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Instantly detects file creations, deletions, and modifications.
- **Flexible Usage**: Can be used both as a command-line tool and a Python module.
- **Detailed Change Information**: Returns detailed information about the type of change and the affected file.

## Installation

You can install the `trackpath` package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install trackpath
```

## Usage

### Command-Line Tool

To monitor a directory from the command line:

This command will print details of any file changes (creation, deletion, modification) detected in the specified directory.

### Python Module

```python
from trackpath import track_changes

# Track changes in the specified directory
change = track_changes("C:/telegram")
if change:
    event_type = change["type"]
    event_path = change["path"]
    if event_type == 'modified':
        print(f"File modified: {event_path}")
    elif event_type == 'created':
        print(f"File created: {event_path}")
    elif event_type == 'deleted':
        print(f"File deleted: {event_path}")
```

### Example

Hereâ€™s an example of using `trackpath` in a Python script:

```python
from trackpath import track_changes

directory_to_monitor = "C:/telegram"

# Continuously monitor the directory
while True:
    change = track_changes(directory_to_monitor)
    if change:
        event_type = change["type"]
        event_path = change["path"]
        print(f"Detected {event_type} at {event_path}")
```
