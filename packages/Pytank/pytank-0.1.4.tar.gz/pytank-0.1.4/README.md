It is designed in such a way that it allows the user to
to develop an analysis using as main principle the material balance
the material balance, using the Havlena Odeh graphical method.
Havlena Odeh graphical method.

Among the different modules we have:
-**Wells**: Allows the creation of objects (Wells), in order to
 to perform the analysis at tank level.
-**Tank**: Allows the grouping of production data, pressure,
 and relevant pvt data of the wells to be analyzed.

-**OilModel**: Allows to set up an oil model based on a PVT data given by
 based on a PVT data given by the user.
-**WaterModel**: Allows to set a water model under
 pressure, temperature and salinity parameters.
-**Aquifer**: Allows to set up a model to determine the reservoir contribution in case of
 reservoir contribution in case it exists or not. The
 user can determine if it is necessary or not to define it.
-**Analysis**: Allows to establish an analysis in a graphical way to determine the POES

 the existence of an aquifer in a graphical way using Campbell's theory,
 allows to calculate the POES in an analytical way by varying the
 parameters that have influence in the analysis, in addition to the

 and to have an idea of the behavior of the tank.

This library works for **Python 3.10** and higher.
