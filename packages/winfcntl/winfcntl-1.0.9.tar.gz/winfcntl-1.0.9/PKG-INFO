A fcntl solution for Windows Operating System created to handle ModuleNotFoundError issues. This package replicates fcntl functionality for Windows, addressing compatibility issues where Unix-specific modules are required but not available.

### How to Use

This package can be used as a replacement for fcntl in Python modules that need cross-platform file control. Import `winfcntl` when running on Windows and `fcntl` on Unix-based systems.

### Usage for Library Developers

Library developers can check the operating system using `os.name` or `platform.system()` to decide whether to import `winfcntl` (for Windows) or `fcntl` (for Unix-based systems). The function names and interfaces are designed to be compatible with `fcntl`.

### Changelog

### Version 1.0.1
- Fixed a small mistake disabling other programs from using the Fcntl class.

### Version 1.0.0
- Initial release.


### Acknowledgments

Thank you to Kiamehr Eskandari for developing this package.
