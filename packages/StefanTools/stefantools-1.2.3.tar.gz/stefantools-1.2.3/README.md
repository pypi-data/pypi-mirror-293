## Warning

There's a class called "input" so if you import this package using "from StefanTools import *" you will lose the ability to use "input()", in that file.

Instead, ALWAYS import this using "import StefanTools".

## Style

This package has errors displayed in the rich style and outputs colorful text which makes things look beautiful in my opinion. If you don't like it, don't use the package.

## Maintaining

This package is a package created for my personal use so don't expect any updating or maintaining unless I need it or feel like it.
