# StefanTools

## Description

This is a package that I use in my every project. I published it so I don't have to sys.path.append every time.

## Importing

Because of a class called "input", if you import this package using "from StefanTools import *" you will lose the ability to use "input()", in that file.

Instead, ALWAYS import this using "import StefanTools".

## Things I'd like to clarify

These are some things I'd like to clarify.

### You can't turn off text being displayed in the rich style

This package uses rich style text and errors which makes things look beautiful in my opinion. If you don't like it, don't use the package.

### Updates come out when I want them to

Because this is created for my personal use don't expect any updating or maintaining unless I need it or feel like it.
