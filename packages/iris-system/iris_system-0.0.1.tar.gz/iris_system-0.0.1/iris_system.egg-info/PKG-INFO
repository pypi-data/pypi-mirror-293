# Iris Recognition System

This project is an iris recognition system ([*See original project.*](https://github.com/andreibercu/iris-recognition)) to analyze and recognize iris images. It includes functionality for feature extraction, comparison of iris features, and performance improvements for various scenarios, including suboptimal camera conditions. The project has been updated to run on Python 3.9.x and includes functionality to save iris data to a database. There are also plans to develop a dynamic system with a GUI or mobile app for real-time use.
