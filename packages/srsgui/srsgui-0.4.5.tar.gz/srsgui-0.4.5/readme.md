# ``Srsgui`` - Organize instrument-controlling Python scripts as a GUI application

`Srsgui` is a simple framework:

   - To define instrument classes for instruments that use remote communication, based on the 
     [`Instrument`](https://thinksrs.github.io/srsgui/srsgui.inst.html#module-srsgui.inst.instrument) 
     class and the communication 
     [`Interface`](https://thinksrs.github.io/srsgui/srsgui.inst.communications.html) classes. 
     (By default, serial and TCPIP is available. VXI11, GPIB and USB-TMC are optional).

   - To write Python scripts (tasks) that run in graphic user interface (GUI) environment using simple
     application programming interfaces (APIs) provided in 
     [``Task``](https://thinksrs.github.io/srsgui/srsgui.task.html) class.

   - To organize instrument classes and task scripts presented in a GUI application
     using a configuration 
     [(.taskconfig)](https://thinksrs.github.io/srsgui/create-project.html#populating-the-taskconfig-file)
     file for a project.

## Installation

To run ``srsgui`` as an GUI application, create a virtual environment, if necessary, 
and install using ``pip`` with the `[full]` option:  

    python -m pip install srsgui[full]

``Srsgui`` package has the following 3 main dependencies: 
[pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/), 
[matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) and
[PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/) 
(or [PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/)). If the installation above fails, 
you have to install the failed pacakge manually. Using a virtual environment will
eliminate possible conflicts between packages in the main Python installation and 
the packages. Some Linux distributions offer certain Python packages from their 
repositories only (not from ``pip``). 
Run a web search for more information on system-specific installation.   

Once pyserial, matplotlib and PySide6 (or PySide2) are installed properly, or if you plan to use 
`srsgui` for instrument drivers only without GUI support, 
you can install ``srsgui`` without the `[full]` option:

    python -m pip install srsgui

## Start ``srsgui`` application
    
If the Python Script directory is in the PATH environment variable,
launch the application by typing the module name into the command line:

    srsgui

If the script directory is not in PATH, run the srsgui module with Python. 

    python -m srsgui


## Run the example project

By default, the `srsgui` application starts with the project that was running when it was closed the last time.
 
To open the [**oscilloscope example project**](https://thinksrs.github.io/srsgui/example.html)
included in the `srsgui` package  
(if `srsgui` does not start with the example project), select File/Open config, 
go to the `srsgui` package directory, find the examples directory, and select the 
`oscilloscope example project.taskconfig` file in the example project folder. 

You can run the **Plot example** and **FFT of simulated waveform** tasks from 
the Task menu without any instruments connected.

## Create a project

`Srsgui` is a framework to help you to write your own instrument-controlling 
Python scripts and run them from a GUI application. Using its APIs, you can write 
scripts running in GUI with the same amount of code as writing console-based 
scripts. For programming using the API, refer to the
[`srsgui` documentation](https://thinksrs.github.io/srsgui).
