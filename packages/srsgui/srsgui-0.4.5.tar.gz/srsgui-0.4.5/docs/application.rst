Running ``srsgui`` application
================================

Starting ``srsgui`` application
---------------------------------

Following proper installation, you can launch the ``srsgui`` application by typing
one of the following commands into a command prompt.
If you installed it with a virtual environment, activate the virtual environment
before starting ``srsgui``.

.. code-block::

    # If python/script directory is in PATH setting,
    srsgui
    
    # If not, 
    python -m srsgui

On initial launch, the GUI window will load the default example project,
and look like this: :ref:`image <top-of-initial-screen-capture>`.

Selecting a configuration file 
-------------------------------

When the ``srsgui`` application starts it loads the last configuration file it used.
If you want to use a different project from the loaded one, you can choose another one
by selecting a configuration file with the .taskconfig extension from the **File/Open** menu.

Connecting instruments to use
------------------------------

To connect to a remote instrument, select the instrument from the **Instruments** menu.
This will bring up a dialog box with connection options. Once an instrument is connected,
the Instrument Info panel displays information about the instrument.

Instruments that will be used in a task must be connected before running the task.
Connection and disconnection to/from an instrument should be handled in the ``srsgui`` application
(or in the .taskconfig file, see :ref:`here <fixed_connection_parameters>`), and not from the task itself.

If you select a instrument that is already connected, it will ask if you want to disconnect the instrument. 

Running a task
---------------
You can choose a task to run from the **Tasks** menu. Once you select a task,
the Parameters panel will display the parameters for the task, 
and the Task Result panel will display the description
of the task (defined by the the class doc string).

After selecting the task you want to run, adjust the Parameters if necessary,
and press the green arrow under the menu toolbar, or select **Control/Run**.

Stopping a running task
------------------------

``Srsgui`` application does not kill a running task. Instead, it sets a flag to indicate 
the stop is requested. The running task should check the flag frequently, and stop at its earliest convenience. 

Saving a data file 
--------------------

Every run of a task automatically generates a data file as
*%USERPROFILE%\\task-results\\the_name_in_taskconfig_file\\RNxxx\\task_name-timestamp.sgdata*.
Typically, the *%USERPROFILE%* directory is *C:\\users\\your_user_name* in Windows.
It is the home directory, *$HOME*, in Linux.

A default instance of the class :class:`TaskResult <srsgui.task.taskresult.TaskResult>` is generated
after an instance of  :class:`Task<srsgui.task.task.Task>` subclass and saved
as a Python dictionary in the data file.

A task can save additional Python dictionaries and create tables for large data sets in the default data file
using APIs in :class:`Task<srsgui.task.task.Task>` class.

Dock widgets in ``srsgui`` application
------------------------------------------ 
 
The ``Srsgui`` application is a Qt application_ built on QMainWindow_ for GUI.
Thanks to Python Qt binder, such as, Pyside6_, we can write Python scripts using the Qt C++ library.

``Srsgui`` extensively uses QDockWidget_ as a container for its widgets,
such as the console, the terminal, and the instrument capture.
By putting the widgets in QDockWidget_, they can be
arranged however you want. Qt dock widgets can be docked anywhere
around the main window, stacked together with one another, closed, or floated (undocked)
outside the main window.

The other major GUI component is Matplotlib_, the most popular Python data visualiation
library. By putting a Matplotlib_ Figure_ in a QDockWidget_, ``srsgui`` provides
flexible layouts of multiple Matplotlib_ plots. Encapsulating Matplotlib Figure_-handling 
into the :class:`Task <srsgui.task.task.Task>` class makes it simple to use a
Matplotlib_ figure_ in :class:`Task <srsgui.task.task.Task>` subclasses.

When you choose a dock widget from the **Docks** menu, it will bring the dock widget
to the top level, even if it was previously closed.

Capture dock widget
-----------------------------

The capture dock widget is the latest addition to the ``srsgui`` application. 
Each instrument in the configuration file will have its own capture dock widget. 
You can open it by selecting the menu item named "*instrument_name-capture*" from the **Docks** menu.

The capture dock is used to provide an interactive snapshot of the instrument state
via a tree view of the :class:`Instrument <srsgui.inst.instrument.Instrument>` class
and its multiple :class:`components <srsgui.inst.component.Component>`,
:mod:`commands <srsgui.inst.commands>` and
:mod:`index commands <srsgui.inst.indexcommands>`.
(This utilizes `Qt Model/View programming. <model_view_programming_>`_)

The capture dock captures the values of :mod:`commands <srsgui.inst.commands>` and
:mod:`index commands <srsgui.inst.indexcommands>`
defined in an instrument class,
and allows you to change the values interactively.

.. note::

    An active capture dock widget generates a lot of communication traffic to the physical
    instrument whenever it needs to update the item values.
    If the running task needs the full communication capacity,
    you can avoid the extra communication load and prevent interference with the task
    by closing the dock widget.

It can display optional insformation:

    - With *Show query-only cmds* option checked, commands that can be queried,
      but not set will be displayed with the [QO] tag after their command name,
      along with the query value.
    - With *Show set-only cmds* option checked, the name of commands that cannot be queried
      will be displayed with the [SO] tag after the command name.
    - With *Show excluded cmds* checked, the name of commands that are intentionally excluded
      will be displayed with the [EX] tag after the command name. The query return value will not be shown.
    - With *Show methods* checked, methods of the components of the instrument class will be displayed
      with the [M] tag after the command name.
      Simple methods that can run without parameters defined and do not return a value
      can be executed directly.
    - With *Show raw cmds* option checked, the raw remote command name associated with the
      item will be shown inside angle brackets, `< >`.

Capture dock widgets help you to understand the hierarchical structure of an instrument class
and to use commands more easily in the command terminal or when writing task scripts in Python.

Plot menu
--------------

When you resize a plot window, sometimes the plot does not fit well in the resized windows.
Pressing **Plot/Adjust Layout** will adjust the layouts of all the plots in the application.
The layout will change with the next update.

All the figures_ used in ``srsgui`` application are accompanied by
`Matplotlib interactive navigation tool bars <toolbar_>`_.
You can show or hide the toolbars in all plot windows
by selecting **Plot/Show or Hide toolbar**.
