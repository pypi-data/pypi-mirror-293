# Crypto Chassis Trade
* A pure Python library for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges.
* More than a library, it syncs exchange data to local memory and keeps track of realtime data updates.
* Unified API for different exchanges.
* Super simple to use. Your code will be in a linear and synchronous manner. The library takes care of asynchronous networking.
* Supported exchanges:
  * Okx.
  * More comming soon...
* Public beta. All kinds of feedbacks and contributions are welcomed.
* Join us on Discord https://discord.gg/b5EKcp9s8T and Medium https://cryptochassis.medium.com.

## Branches
* The `main` branch may contain experimental features.
* The `release` branch represents the most recent stable release.

## Installation
