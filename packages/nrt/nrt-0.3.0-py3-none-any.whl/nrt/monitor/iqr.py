    """Online monitoring of disturbances based on interquartile range

        Reference:
            https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/1153

    Attributes:
        mask (numpy.ndarray): A 2D numpy array containing pixels that should
            be monitored (1) and not (0). The mask may be updated following
            history period stability check, and after a call to monitor
            following a confirmed break. Values are as follow.
            ``{0: 'Not monitored', 1: 'monitored', 2: 'Unstable history',
            3: 'Confirmed break - no longer monitored'}``
        trend (bool): Indicate whether stable period fit is performed with
            trend or not
        harmonic_order (int): The harmonic order of the time-series regression
        beta (np.ndarray): 3D array containing the model coefficients
        x (numpy.ndarray): array of x coordinates
        y (numpy.ndarray): array of y coordinates
        sensitivity (float): sensitivity of the monitoring. Lower numbers are
            high sensitivity. Value can't be zero.
        boundary (int): Number of consecutive observations identified as outliers
            to signal as disturbance
        q25 (numpy.ndarray): 25th percentile of residuals
        q75 (numpy.ndarray): 75th percentile of residuals
        detection_date (numpy.ndarray): 2D array signalling detection date of
            disturbances in days since 1970-01-01

    Args:
        mask (numpy.ndarray): A 2D numpy array containing pixels that should be
            monitored marked as ``1`` and pixels that should be excluded (marked
            as ``0``). Typically a stable forest mask when doing forest disturbance
            monitoring. If no mask is supplied all pixels are considered and
            a mask is created following the ``fit()`` call
        trend (bool): Indicate whether stable period fit is performed with
            trend or not
        harmonic_order (int): The harmonic order of the time-series regression
        sensitivity (float): sensitivity of the monitoring. Lower numbers are
            high sensitivity. Value can't be zero.
        boundary (int): Number of consecutive observations identified as outliers
            to signal as disturbance

            ``.from_netcdf()``
