class MoSum(BaseNrt):
    """Monitoring using moving sums (MOSUM) of residuals

    Implementation following method as implemented in R package bFast.

    Attributes:
        mask (numpy.ndarray): A 2D numpy array containing pixels that should
            be monitored (1) and not (0). The mask may be updated following
            history period stability check, and after a call to monitor
            following a confirmed break. Values are as follow.
            ``{0: 'Not monitored', 1: 'monitored', 2: 'Unstable history',
            3: 'Confirmed break - no longer monitored'}``
        trend (bool): Indicate whether stable period fit is performed with
            trend or not
        harmonic_order (int): The harmonic order of the time-series regression
        x (numpy.ndarray): array of x coordinates
        y (numpy.ndarray): array of y coordinates
        sensitivity (float): sensitivity of the monitoring. Lower numbers
            correspond to lower sensitivity. Equivalent to significance level
            'alpha' with which the boundary is computed
        boundary (numpy.ndarray): process boundary for each time series.
            Calculated from alpha and length of time series.
        sigma (numpy.ndarray): Standard deviation for normalized residuals in
            history period
        histsize (numpy.ndarray): Number of non-nan observations in history
            period
        n (numpy.ndarray): Total number of non-nan observations in time-series
        critval (float): Critical test value corresponding to the chosen
            sensitivity
        h (float): Moving window size relative to length of the history period.
            Can be one of 0.25, 0.5 and 1
        winsize (numpy.ndarray): 2D array with absolute window size. Computed as
            h*histsize
        window (numpy.ndarray): 3D array containing the current values in the
            window
        detection_date (numpy.ndarray): 2D array signalling detection date of
            disturbances in days since 1970-01-01

    Args:
        mask (numpy.ndarray): A 2D numpy array containing pixels that should be
            monitored marked as ``1`` and pixels that should be excluded (marked
            as ``0``). Typically a stable forest mask when doing forest disturbance
            monitoring. If no mask is supplied all pixels are considered and
            a mask is created following the ``fit()`` call
        trend (bool): Indicate whether stable period fit is performed with
            trend or not
        harmonic_order (int): The harmonic order of the time-series regression
        sensitivity (float): sensitivity of the monitoring. Lower numbers
            correspond to lower sensitivity. Equivalent to significance level
            'alpha' with which the boundary is computed
        h (float): Moving window size relative to length of the history period.
            Can be one of 0.25, 0.5 and 1
