    """Monitoring using EWMA control chart

    Implementation following method described in Brooks et al. 2014.

    Args:
        mask (numpy.ndarray): A 2D numpy array containing pixels that should be
            monitored marked as ``1`` and pixels that should be excluded (marked
            as ``0``). Typically a stable forest mask when doing forest disturbance
            monitoring. If no mask is supplied all pixels are considered and
            a mask is created following the ``fit()`` call
        trend (bool): Indicate whether stable period fit is performed with
            trend or not
        harmonic_order (int): The harmonic order of the time-series regression
        lambda_ (float): Weight of previous observation in the monitoring process
            (memory). Valid range is [0,1], 1 corresponding to no memory and 0 to
            full memory
        sensitivity (float): Sensitivity parameter used in the computation of the
            monitoring boundaries. Lower values imply more sensitive monitoring
        threshold_outlier (float): Values bigger than threshold_outlier*sigma
            (extreme outliers) will get screened out during monitoring and will
            not contribute to updating the EWMA process value
