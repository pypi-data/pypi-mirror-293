# meta-features
Repository for extracting features for meta-learning.

Meta features are essential components in the field of meta-learning. These features serve as valuable indicators or descriptors that capture important characteristics of the underlying data. By extracting and analyzing these meta features, researchers and practitioners can gain insights into the data distribution, complexity, and other relevant properties. Meta features play a crucial role in tasks such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization, and dataset characterization. They enable the development of effective meta-learning algorithms and contribute to the advancement of this exciting field.


`Note: The project is under development. It will be release for public use soon.`
