the way to transform ECG image to signal
you can use this code to transform ECG image to signal, which is a 1D signal.
First,you need to create your own conda environment,we recommend you to use python==3.9.7

    scikit-learn==1.24.0
    scikit-image
    unzip
    joblib
    pandas
    matplotlib
    natsort
    streamlit

you can alos use requirements.txt to install the required packages by pip install -r requirements.txt

then, you should find your app.py file, which is the main file of the project.
In the app.py file, you can modify the code to fit your own ECG image.

Finally, you can run the code by:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

if you can't open the webpage, you can update the streamlit version==1.37.0.

if you run the code with AxiosError: Request failed with status code 403, you can use the following command to run the code:

```
streamlit run app.py --server.enableXsrfProtection=false
```
