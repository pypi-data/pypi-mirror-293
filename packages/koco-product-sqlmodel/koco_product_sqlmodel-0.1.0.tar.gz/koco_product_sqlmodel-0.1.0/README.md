# koco-product-sqlmodel

This project separates the product describing SQLMODEL from other modules making later use of it. It shall be implemented into the CatalogDB-project and into a separate API project.

## Scope

The module will contain all necessary *sqlmodel*-classes and functions to make an interaction with a KOCO-product-database possible. It shall be available under MIT-license on *pip*.

## Dependencies

The module depends on Tiangolo's [sqlmodel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/)-package, which is also licensed under [MIT-License](https://github.com/fastapi/sqlmodel/blob/main/LICENSE).
