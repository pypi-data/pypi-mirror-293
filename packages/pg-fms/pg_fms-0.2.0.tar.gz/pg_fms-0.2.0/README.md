## Overall Description

### Product Perspective

PG-FMS is a standalone file management system developed to operate across various platforms, ensuring compatibility with different operating environments and system configurations.

### Product Functions

- **File Operations:** Move, copy, rename, and delete files.
- **File Filtering:** Filter files based on type, size, and date modified.

### User Classes and Characteristics

Users include administrators and end-users seeking efficient file management solutions. Admins have access to all features, while end-users have restricted capabilities based on permissions.

### Operating Environment

PG-FMS operates on Python, compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. It requires minimal system resources and supports integration with existing software environments.

### Design and Implementation Constraints

PG-FMS adheres to Python programming standards and integrates with standard libraries for file system operations. It maintains compatibility with Python versions 3.6 and above.

### User Documentation

Comprehensive user manuals and online help guides are provided to assist users in installing, configuring, and utilizing PG-FMS effectively.

### Assumptions and Dependencies

PG-FMS assumes a stable operating environment with access to standard Python libraries and consistent file system configurations across different platforms.

---

## External Interface Requirements

### User Interfaces

PG-FMS utilizes a command-line interface (CLI) for user interactions, providing a straightforward method for executing file management commands and operations.

### Hardware Interfaces

PG-FMS interacts with standard hardware components such as storage devices and network interfaces, ensuring seamless data transfer and management.

### Software Interfaces

PG-FMS integrates with Python's standard libraries for file handling and system operations, maintaining compatibility with operating system-specific APIs and libraries.

### Communications Interfaces

PG-FMS does not require external communication interfaces beyond standard system protocols used for file transfer and data management.

## System Features

### Feature 1: File Operations

- **Description and Priority:** Implement basic file operations including move, copy, rename, and delete files. (High)
- **Stimulus/Response Sequences:** User initiates commands via CLI; PG-FMS performs specified file operation and provides confirmation or error messages.
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - REQ-1: Allow users to move files between directories.
  - REQ-2: Enable users to copy files with specified source and destination paths.
  - REQ-3: Provide functionality to rename files based on user-provided new names.
  - REQ-4: Support deletion of files with confirmation prompts.

### Feature 2: File Filtering

- **Description and Priority:** Implement advanced file filtering capabilities based on file attributes such as type, size, and date modified. (Medium)
- **Stimulus/Response Sequences:** User specifies filtering criteria via CLI arguments; PG-FMS filters files accordingly and displays results.
- **Functional Requirements:**
  - REQ-5: Filter files by file type (e.g., text files, images, documents).
  - REQ-6: Filter files by size range (e.g., greater than 1MB, less than 100KB).
  - REQ-7: Filter files based on date modified (e.g., last 7 days, last month).

## Other Nonfunctional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

- PG-FMS should execute file operations efficiently, with response times under one second for typical file management tasks.
- File filtering operations should complete within reasonable timeframes, even with large datasets.

### Safety Requirements

- PG-FMS should prevent accidental file deletions by requiring user confirmation before executing delete operations.
- Error handling mechanisms should ensure that critical file operations do not result in data loss or corruption.

### Security Requirements

- PG-FMS must implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access based on user roles and permissions.
- File operations should comply with security protocols and standards to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of sensitive data.

### Software Quality Attributes

- PG-FMS prioritizes reliability and robustness, ensuring consistent performance across different operating systems and environments.
- The system should be maintainable, allowing for easy updates and enhancements without disrupting existing functionality.

### Business Rules

- Admin users have full access to all file management features and settings.
- End-users may have restricted access based on their assigned roles and permissions within the system.
