This is a simple monitoring class built around psutil. The idea is that this will monitor cpu and ram usage between starting and stopping the monitoring. 

1) To use simply import the package: ```from emerald_monitor import ResourceMonitor```

2) Then you can initialize the monitor: ```monitor = ResourceMonitor()```

3) Start the logger: ```monitor.start_logging()```

4) Run any function or process

5) Stop the logger: ```monitor.stop_logging()```

You can view a plot of the logs using:
  - ```monitor.plot_logs()```

and, you can view the logs as a pandas dataframe:
  - ```monitor_info = monitor.get_logs()```.

And, of course you can export the logs using pandas export options. For example:
  - ```monitor_info.to_csv(<output file path>, index=False)```
