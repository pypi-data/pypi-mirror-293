    """Calculates the equation of time and Sun's declination at a given time.

    The term equation of time referes to the difference between mean solar time (what you would get
    if the sun had uniform motion along the celestial equator) and apparent solar time (what you
    would get by measuing the angle of the sun and calculating the time). This is because the
    ecliptic is tilted relative to Earth's equator and the Earth's orbit has eccentricity.
    See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time

    The declination of the sun is the angle between the Sun's rays and the plane of Earth's equator.
    It's periodic with the orbit of Earth around the Sun.
