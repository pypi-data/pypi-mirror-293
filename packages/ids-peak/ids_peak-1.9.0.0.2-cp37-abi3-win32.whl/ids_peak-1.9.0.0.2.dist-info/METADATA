ids_peak provides python bindings
for the IDS peak genericAPI. It exposes all the
functionality of the peak genericAPI and __requires__
at least the drivers and GenICam transport layers to be installed,
which are included in the IDS peak SDK.

Benefit from many Python __advantages__, for example the __interactive__
programming of your IDS camera.
Write and test small code snippets
without the complex setup of a programming IDE including a toolchain.
This package is __ideal for prototyping__ IDS
camera applications for all supported peak genericAPI platforms
(Windows, Linux, Linux Embedded).

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install ids_peak
```

## Quickstart

This example shows how to open a device, start image acquisition
and how to convert a buffer to an `ids_peak_ipl.Image`.

NOTE: *For the sake of simplicity, most of the error checking has been
omitted in this example.*

```python
from ids_peak import ids_peak

        # needs to live as long as the class that would call it,
        # so as long as the device manager in this case
        # If the callback gets garbage collected it deregisters itself
        device_found_callback = device_manager.DeviceFoundCallback(
            lambda found_device: print(
