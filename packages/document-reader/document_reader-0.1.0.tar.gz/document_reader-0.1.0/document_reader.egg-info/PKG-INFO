# document_reader

A wrapper of different reading document python packages. The idea is to get a structured markdown string output out of any document. I am using the RFP+ code as a baseline: https://github.com/bearingpoint-no/generative-anbud.git

# Setup Instructions

1) Clone the GitHub repository
2) Clone the repository into a folder on your computer or virtual machine:
3) Create a virtual environment
4) install the required dependencies (use Python 3.11.9 or a compatible version):
6) Set env variables according to the format described below (you will need an Azure LLM deployment for vision)
7) You will find a quick example of how to run the code in the main.py file. Use it to test the code and understand its functionality

# setting env variables

You will need to set values for these environment variables:
    OPENAI_API_MODEL 
    OPENAI_API_VERSION
    OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_GPT4_TURBO_VISION
    OPENAI_API_KEY
    AZURE_ENDPOINT

# WARNINGS

- the vision part writes down descriptions in English for now

Small images (less than 200 of length or width)  wont be read  !
