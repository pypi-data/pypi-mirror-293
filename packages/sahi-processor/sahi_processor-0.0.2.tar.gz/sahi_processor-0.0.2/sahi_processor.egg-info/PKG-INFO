# SAHI_processor
Using SAHI as a pre and post processing step

## Impetus
To make it easier to use sahi without changes to the main model inference code.

## How to use
Install package with 
```
pip install sahi_processor
```

Sample usage
```
from sahi_processor.sahi_processor import SAHIProcessor

processor = SAHIProcessor()
batched_images = processor.get_slice_batches(list_of_images, model_batchsize=batchsize)

# run batched_images through your model and output predictions
# combine all batches of predictions into  List[List[l, t, r, b, score, class_id]]

merged_predictions = processor.run_sahi_algo(list_of_images, predictions)
```

A sample test script can be ran via `python tests/test.py`

## Formats to note
`list_of_images` is a list of cv2 images in `(H, W, C)`

`predictions` is a list of predictions for each image.
Below is a sample:
```
[
    [ 
        [l, t, r, b, score, class_id],
        [l, t, r, b, score, class_id], ...
    ],...
]
```
