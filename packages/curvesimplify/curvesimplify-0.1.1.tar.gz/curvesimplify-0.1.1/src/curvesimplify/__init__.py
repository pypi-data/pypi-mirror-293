"""CurveSimplify is a collection of polyline simplifying functions.

Each module defines the following functions:

* ``min_err()`` : Minimize the simplification error with given number of vertices.
* ``min_num()`` : Minimize the number of vertices with given  simplificationerror.

The following types of errors are supported:

1. ``frechet`` : Fr√©chet distance
