![title](https://curvesimplify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/plot-header.png)

A Python package for polygonal curve simplification.

List of supported algorithms:
- Imai-Iri algorithm (`curvesimplify.imaiiri`)
- Agarwal's algorithm (`curvesimplify.agarwal`)

## Usage

```python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from curvesimplify.agarwal import min_err
>>> x = np.linspace(0, 5, 50)
>>> f = np.exp(-x) * np.cos(2 * np.pi * x)
>>> curve = np.column_stack([x, f])
>>> simp, err = min_err(curve, 10)
>>> len(simp)  # at most 10
10
```

## Installation

CurveSimplify can be installed using `pip`.

```
$ pip install curvesimplify
```

## Documentation

CurveSimplify is documented with [Sphinx](https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/).
The manual can be found on Read the Docs:

If you want to build the document yourself, get the source code and install with `[doc]` dependency.
Then, go to `doc` directory and build the document:

```
$ pip install .[doc]
$ cd doc
$ make html
```

Document will be generated in `build/html` directory. Open `index.html` to see the central page.
