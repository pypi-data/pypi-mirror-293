Web2sdk is a set of tools for reverse engineering APIs by intercepting network requests. It processes HAR files exported from Chrome devtools into an OpenAPI schema, then automatically generates a python SDK based on the schema. Each method in the python SDK corresponds to an endpoint, and includes strongly typed arguments, requests, and responses.

### Features
- Generates an OpenAPI/Swagger yaml schema from any web-based flow
- Automatically merges requests to the same endpoint
- Generates pydantic classes based on OpenAPI request and response schemas
- Supports `basic` and `bearer` auth schemes
- Supports overriding default headers 

## Usage
**1. Export HAR file**
* Open Chrome devtools and go to "Network".
* Go through a flow on a website that triggers the requests you want to capture and reverse engineer. The more varied the requests the better, as a single request might not capture all the possible request and response schemas for a particular endpoint.
* Click the button shown below to export the HAR file. Don't worry about filtering out requests, that happens later.
* Also compatible with [mitmweb](https://mitmproxy.org/) exports.

**2. Install web2sdk**
```
$ pip install web2sdk
```

**3. Generate an OpenAPI spec and SDK**
```sh
$ web2sdk --requests-path <path/to/har/or/flow/file> --base-url <https://finic.ai/api/v1> --sdk-name FinicSDK --auth-type bearer
```
* `base-url` filters out requests that don't start with the url provided. This should include everything up until the endpoints you want to reverse engineer.
* For example, `https://finic.ai/api/v1` will match only requests to the v1 endpiont, but `https://finic.ai/api` will match requests from v1, v2, and any other paths after `/api`.
* Generated files will be saved to `generated/<sdk_name>.yaml` and `generated/<sdk_name>.py` in the current directory by default.

**4. Run your python SDK.**
```python
from generated.FinicSDK import FinicSDK

finic = FinicSDK(hostname="finic.ai", token="your_token_here")
finic.get_connectors({})
finic.post_message({ message: "hi there" }, override_headers={ "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7)" })
```
* Each method in the generated SDK corresponds to an endpoint
* You can pass in any headers you want. By default, only `Authorization` and `User-Agent` headers are included.
* Some methods accept parameters and/or request bodies. Inspect the function to see what arguments it takes.

### Other Options
```-- auth <basic|bearer>```
* Optional, defaults to `none`. If set, the generated SDK class will expect a username and password for basic auth or a token for bearer auth.

```--output```
* Optional, defaults to `generated/` in the current directory. Specify a directory for the generated `.yaml` and `.py` files to be saved.

```--interactive```
* Run in interactive mode. Not well supported.

## ðŸš§ Planned Improvements
- Support for oauth and custom auth schemes. In the mean
- Automatic auth token refresh
- Support for templated API paths (e.g. `https://api.claude.ai/api/organizations/{organization_id}/chat_conversations`)
- Use LLMs to generate more readable class names, example request payloads, and other tasks that require fuzzy reasoning
- Include a linter/formatter to make generated SDK more readable
