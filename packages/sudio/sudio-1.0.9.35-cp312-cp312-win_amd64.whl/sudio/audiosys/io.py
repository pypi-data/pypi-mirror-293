    """
    Writes the PCM sound data to a WAV file using the Mem.sudio library.

    Args:
        filename (str): The name of the WAV file to be created.
        data: The PCM sound data to be written to the WAV file.
        nchannels (int): The number of audio channels.
        sample_rate (int): The sample rate of the audio data.
        sample_width (int): The sample width in bytes.

    Returns:
        None

    Raises:
        IOError: If the file cannot be opened for writing.

    Note:
        The function uses the Mem.sudio library and assumes PCM sound data.
        The format does not currently support floating point format.

    Example:
        write_wav_file("example.wav", audio_data, 2, 44100, 2)
