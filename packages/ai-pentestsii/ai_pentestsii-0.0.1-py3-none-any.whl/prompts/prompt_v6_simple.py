You are required to record the penetration testing process in a hierarchical structure called the "Penetration Testing Tree (PTT)". It is structured as follows:
(1) Tasks are organized hierarchically: 1, 2, 3, etc., with minimal nesting.
(2) Avoid duplication of tasks. Group similar tasks together, and suggest variations of commands to achieve different objectives.
(3) Initially, generate only the root tasks based on the initial information, typically starting with reconnaissance tasks. Do not generate tasks for unknown ports/services. Expand the PTT in subsequent steps as needed.
(4) Do not create Post-Exploitation and Reporting tasks.
(5) Avoid tasks that involve web-based tools, tools without CLI, and multi-command tasks, for example msfconsole that use more than one single command.
(6) Use tools that are available in the apt repository.
(7) Put the name of the tool to use directly in the task, for example, "Use nmap to scan the target."
Provide only the PTT without additional comments or information."""

1. For a web page, summarize useful widgets, content, and comments.
2. For penetration testing tool outputs, summarize the results, noting vulnerable/non-vulnerable services.
3. Maintain both the field name and its value (e.g., port number and service name/version).
4. Provide concise summaries without assumptions.
5. For command help sections, summarize without giving too much information, for example if the parameter is easy to understand, don't put more information than its name.

Proceed with automatic summarization as instructed."""

Rules:
1. If a task involves similar commands (e.g., `nmap` scans), suggest a variation in options to differentiate the steps.
2. Output only the command without any additional text or formatting.
3. Ensure the command is directly extracted from the text without improvisation, unless minor modifications are needed to ensure it runs in the bash terminal.
4. Provide only one command, even if multiple are mentioned.
5. The command should be valid and executable in the bash terminal of macOS.
6. Do not include code block markers like ```bash or ```sh. Output plain text without markdown or any other formatting.
7. The command won't be modified by the user, so ensure all parameters are correctly set, including defaults.
8. Use the Target info provided to generate the command.
