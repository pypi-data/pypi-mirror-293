"""
Service Class: base definition
Service: an instance of a service class
Service*: instantiated and deployed/described
ServiceGroup: instance of declared ServiceGroup class
ServiceGroup*: selected & deployed group of GCP services
Node: associated with Service
Node*: associated with Service*

Before deployment / describe:
=============================

    What is declared by the user:
    -----------------------------
    Service -- member_of --> ServiceGroup

    What can be built without deployment / describe phase:
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Node --> Service --> ServiceGroup

After deployment / describe
===========================

    The Refs come from "describing" / "listing" GCP services.
    They are automatically populated in the Spec of the Services*.

    Ref -- selfLink --> Service
    Ref -- uses     --> Ref
    Ref -- used_by  --> Ref

    Ref --> Service Class
    Ref --> Service Class Unknown
    Ref --> Service
    Ref --> Service*

    At this point, we can build Nodes and Edges:

    Service  --> Node
    Service* --> Node*

    Edge: Node* -- uses --> Node
    Edge: Node* -- uses --> Node*

    Edge: Node* -- used_by --> Node
    Edge: Node* -- used_by --> Node*

NOTE Without the deployment / describe phase, we do not have
     access to the Refs and thus cannot be building Edges.

     But we can have Groups of Nodes though.

     Node  -- member_of --> Group
     Node* -- member_of --> Group

NOTE There are provisions for Group -- ? --> Group edges
     but no use-case nor implementation yet.
