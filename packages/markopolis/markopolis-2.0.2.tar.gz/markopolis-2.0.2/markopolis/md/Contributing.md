Contributions are most welcome. I am looking to add several features
to this project and would appreciate any and all help I can get.
Check out the [[Roadmap]] for a list of features I currently plan to implement.

Below are few things I need help with:

- Unit testing
- User feedback
- Obsidian plugin development
- Figuring out the best strategy to implement Sync
- Front-end improvements

Please feel free to connect with me on github by opening an issue or drop an email.
Any and all help is appreciated :)
