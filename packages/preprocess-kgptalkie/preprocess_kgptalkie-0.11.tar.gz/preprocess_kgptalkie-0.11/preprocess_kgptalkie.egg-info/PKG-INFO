```

## How to Use the Package

### 1. Basic Text Preprocessing

#### Lowercasing Text

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

text = "HELLO WORLD!"
processed_text = ps.to_lower_case(text)
print(processed_text)  # Output: hello world!
```

#### Expanding Contractions

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

text = "I'm learning NLP."
processed_text = ps.contraction_to_expansion(text)
print(processed_text)  # Output: I am learning NLP.
```

#### Removing Emails

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

text = "Contact me at example@example.com"
processed_text = ps.remove_emails(text)
print(processed_text)  # Output: Contact me at 
```

#### Removing URLs

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

text = "Check out https://example.com"
processed_text = ps.remove_urls(text)
print(processed_text)  # Output: Check out
```

#### Removing HTML Tags

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

text = "<p>Hello World!</p>"
processed_text = ps.remove_html_tags(text)
print(processed_text)  # Output: Hello World!
```

#### Removing Special Characters

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

text = "Hello @World! #NLP"
processed_text = ps.remove_special_chars(text)
print(processed_text)  # Output: Hello World NLP
```

### 2. Advanced Text Processing

#### Lemmatization

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

text = "running runs"
processed_text = ps.lemmatize(text)
print(processed_text)  # Output: run run
```

#### Sentiment Analysis

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

text = "I love programming!"
sentiment = ps.sentiment_analysis(text)
print(sentiment)  # Output: Sentiment(polarity=0.5, subjectivity=0.6)
```

#### Detecting and Translating Language

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps
from googletrans import Translator

translator = Translator()
text = "Bonjour tout le monde"
lang = ps.detect_language(text, translator)
translated_text = ps.translate(text, 'en', translator)
print(f"Language: {lang}, Translated: {translated_text}")
# Output: Language: fr, Translated: Hello everyone
```

### 3. Feature Extraction

#### Word Count

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

text = "I love NLP."
count = ps.word_count(text)
print(count)  # Output: 3
```

#### Character Count

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

text = "I love NLP."
count = ps.char_count(text)
print(count)  # Output: 9
```

#### N-Grams

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

text = "I love NLP"
ngrams = ps.n_grams(text, n=2)
print(ngrams)  # Output: [('I', 'love'), ('love', 'NLP')]
```

### 4. Full Example: Cleaning Text

Hereâ€™s an example of how you might use several functions together to clean text data:

```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

text = "I'm loving this NLP tutorial! Contact me at udemy@kgptalkie.com. Visit https://kgptalkie.com."
cleaned_text = ps.clean_text(text)
print(cleaned_text)
# Output: i am loving this nlp tutorial contact me at visit
```

### One Short Feature Extraction
```python
import preprocess_kgptalkie as ps

ps.extract_features("I love NLP")
```

## Notes

- Be cautious when using heavy operations like `lemmatize` and `spelling_correction` on very large datasets, as they can be time-consuming.
- The package supports custom cleaning and preprocessing pipelines by using these modular functions together.
